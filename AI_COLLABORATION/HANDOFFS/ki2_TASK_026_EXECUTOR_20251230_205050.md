files_changed:
  - scripts/walk_forward_yearly_transfer.py
  - results/yearly_transfer_matrix.json
summary:
  - Created scripts/walk_forward_yearly_transfer.py (520 lines)
  - Transfer matrix trains on Year X, tests on Year Y (all combinations)
  - Uses frozen rules from position_rule_layer (same as walk_forward_param_grid.py)
  - BH/FDR correction applied for multiple comparisons (48 tests)
  - Output: results/yearly_transfer_matrix.json (28KB)
  - Key finding: 0/48 FDR-significant, mean OOS delta_roi=-9.51pp
  - Forward transfer slightly better (-2.03pp) than backward (-16.99pp)
  - Repro: python scripts/walk_forward_yearly_transfer.py --output results/yearly_transfer_matrix.json

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-year-pair
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): train_year, test_year, roi_delta, hit_rate, bigwin_count, fdr_significant
- Rule 4 (target metric): generalization (ROI stability across year-pairs)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/walk_forward_yearly_transfer.py --output results/yearly_transfer_matrix.json -> results/yearly_transfer_matrix.json

## Repro Commands
