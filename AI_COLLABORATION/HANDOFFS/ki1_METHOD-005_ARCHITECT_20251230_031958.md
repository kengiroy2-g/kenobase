files_changed:
  - kenobase/analysis/number_representations.py (already complete, 329 LOC)
  - tests/unit/test_number_representations.py (already complete, 262 LOC, 16 tests)
summary:
  - Module number_representations.py already fully implemented
  - 5 representation types: sum, mean, centroid, presence_vector, normalized_vector
  - All 16 unit tests pass (pytest verified)
  - GameTimeSeries dataclass with cross-game normalization support
  - align_time_series() and get_train_test_split() for downstream analysis
  - Ready for TRANS-001..TRANS-004 which add Summen-Signatur, Dekaden, etc.
  - No code changes needed; task is COMPLETE

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw (each lottery draw gets a representation)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): sum/mean/centroid = scalar, presence_vector/normalized_vector = multi-dim
- Rule 4 (target metric): time-series cross-game coupling analysis
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (module is pure transformation, no I/O)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_number_representations.py -v` -> 16 passed

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw (each lottery draw → one representation)
- Semantics: sum/mean/centroid/presence_vector/normalized_vector
- Target metric: enable Granger/DTW/MI/TE analysis on lottery time-series

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_number_representations.py -v` → 16 passed (1.67s)

# Implementierungsplan
