# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-number
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): combined_score (0-1), tier (A/B/C), 20 feature columns
- Rule 4 (target metric): bet-selection
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_features.py -v` -> 29 passed

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-number (1-70 for KENO)
- Semantics: combined_score 0-1 normalized, tier A/B/C classification
- Target metric: bet-selection

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_features.py -v` -> 29 passed in 1.27s
- `pytest tests/unit/test_features.py --cov=kenobase/features` -> 84% coverage
