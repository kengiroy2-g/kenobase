validated_handoff: "ki0_COUPLE-002_PROXY_IMPL_20251230_051251.md"
summary:
  - All 23 unit tests pass (2.68s) covering PLV, circular mean, surrogates, spectral computation, synthetic sinusoids, null control, and CLI schema
  - CLI help verified: analyze_cross_spectrum_coupling.py with all parameters
  - Module exports verified: 8 public symbols correctly exported from kenobase.analysis
  - Acceptance criteria met: BH-corrected q-values, negative_control flag, tests pass, repro commands documented
  - Architecture plan verified: CPSD/coherence via scipy.signal, phase-randomized and block surrogates
  - EuroJackpot correctly treated as negative control per CLAUDE.md section 1.2
  - Code quality: 722 lines main module, 467 lines tests, clean dataclass design

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-market (lottery pair + representation + frequency band)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): CPSD/coherence/phase-lag per FrequencyBand, BH-corrected q-values
- Rule 4 (target metric): accuracy (correct detection of inverse/periodic coupling with FDR control)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_cross_spectrum_coupling.py -v` -> 23 passed in 2.68s

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-market (lottery pair + representation + frequency band)
- Semantics: Cross-spectrum coherence + PLV per FrequencyBand, BH-corrected q-values
- Target metric: accuracy (correct detection of inverse/periodic coupling with FDR control)

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_cross_spectrum_coupling.py -v` -> 23 passed in 2.68s
- `python scripts/analyze_cross_spectrum_coupling.py --help` -> shows CLI options
- `python -c "from kenobase.analysis import analyze_spectral_coupling; print('OK')"` -> import verified

# Validation

**APPROVED** - All 23 tests pass, CLI verified, module exports correct, all acceptance criteria met.
