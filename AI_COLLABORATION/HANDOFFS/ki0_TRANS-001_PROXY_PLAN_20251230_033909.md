status: APPROVED
task: TRANS-001
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_TRANS-001_ARCHITECT_20251230_033709.md"
summary:
  - Plan uses per-KENO-type Summen-Signatur (sum_total, type bucket, parity_vector, decade_hist, checksum) consistent with Axiom-First ADR and train<2024/test≥2024 split.
  - Integration covers new analysis module, CLI/config switches, pipeline hook, and CURRENT_STATUS artifact entry to keep determinism visible.
  - Validation path includes unit + golden samples on bucket/parity/hash determinism and smoke CLI run writing fixed results/summen_signatur*.json artifact.
  - Gaps: SYSTEM_STATUS.json and KI profile ki0_proxy.md missing; repro command/output path not specified—needs locking in execution.

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): UNVERIFIED (SYSTEM_STATUS.json missing; read SYSTEM_STATUS.md instead)
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-team (per KENO type/pick-count)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): sum_total, type-specific sum_bucket, parity_vector, decade_hist, checksum
- Rule 4 (target metric): accuracy (deterministic reproduction)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): UNVERIFIED (KI profile ki0_proxy.md missing)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): UNVERIFIED (CLI command/output path not defined)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-team (per KENO type/pick-count)
- Semantics: sum_total, type-specific sum_bucket, parity_vector, decade_hist, checksum
- Target metric: accuracy (deterministic reproduction)

## Repro Commands
- UNVERIFIED

# Proxy Review
- Plan aligns with ADR_AXIOM_FIRST_FRAMEWORK: per-type buckets/parity/decade rules and frozen train<2024/test≥2024 split match Axiom-first and train/test guardrails.
- Integration path covers required touchpoints (analysis module + CLI/config switch + pipeline hook + CURRENT_STATUS artifact), avoiding BUG-003.
- Validation includes deterministic unit + golden edge cases plus smoke CLI artifact; however, the actual repro command/output path still needs to be specified and locked.
- System context gaps: SYSTEM_STATUS.json and KI profile ki0_proxy.md are absent (used SYSTEM_STATUS.md instead), so helper-boundaries/known integration points remain unverified; executor should confirm before changes.
