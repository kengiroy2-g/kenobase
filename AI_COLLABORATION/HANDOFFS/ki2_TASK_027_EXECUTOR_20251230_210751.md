  - scripts/walk_forward_lookback_grid.py
  - results/walk_forward_lookback_grid.json
summary:
  - Created new script walk_forward_lookback_grid.py for dedicated lookback period optimization
  - Implements lookback grid [30, 60, 90, 180, 365, 540, 730] days per plan
  - Uses existing BH/FDR infrastructure from walk_forward_param_grid.py
  - Outputs best_lookback_by_type with delta_roi metric per keno_type (6-10)
  - Includes lookback_matrix for cross-comparison of all lookback x type combinations
  - Full run completed successfully (0.8s, 7 lookbacks x 5 types = 35 comparisons)
  - FDR correction applied: 0/35 significant at alpha=0.10 (no rules passed validation)
  - Output saved to results/walk_forward_lookback_grid.json

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-keno_type (Typ 6-10)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): recent_draws = lookback window in days, delta_roi = rules_roi - baseline_roi
- Rule 4 (target metric): delta_roi (ROI improvement durch rules vs baseline frequency)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (standalone script)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/walk_forward_lookback_grid.py --output results/walk_forward_lookback_grid.json` -> results/walk_forward_lookback_grid.json

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/walk_forward_lookback_grid.py --output results/walk_forward_lookback_grid.json`
