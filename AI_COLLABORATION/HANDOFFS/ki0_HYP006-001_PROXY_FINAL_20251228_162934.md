status: COMPLETE
task: HYP006-001
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - Validator APPROVED with 38/38 unit tests passed
  - All 3 deliverables verified present and syntactically valid
  - Acceptance Criteria AC1-AC6 all TRUE in artifact
  - JSON artifact contains 8 keys with comprehensive WGZ analysis
  - recurrence_rate=1.0 (100%), avg_recurrence_count=5.73
  - GK1 correlation correctly marked as not significant (data limitation acknowledged)
  - No code changes were required - implementation was pre-existing and complete
  - Task HYP006-001 COMPLETE - ready for closure

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): recurrence_rate, avg_recurrence_count, pair_stability, gk1_correlation, streaks, weekly_cycle, recurrence_7d
- Rule 4 (target metric): Pattern-Erkennung (Wiederholungsrate)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_recurrence.py -v` -> 38 passed; `python scripts/analyze_hyp006.py` -> results/hyp006/wgz_analysis.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (alle Ziehungen)
- Semantics: recurrence, pair_stability, gk1_correlation, streaks, weekly_cycle, recurrence_7d
- Target metric: recurrence_rate (100%), avg_recurrence_count (5.73)

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_recurrence.py -v` -> 38 passed in 0.84s
- `python scripts/analyze_hyp006.py` -> results/hyp006/wgz_analysis.json

# Proxy Final Review

**DECISION: COMPLETE**

All critical aspects verified:
1. Validator approved with 38/38 tests passing
2. All deliverables exist and are syntactically valid
3. All 6 Acceptance Criteria (AC1-AC6) met
4. No architecture questions requiring user decision
5. No breaking changes - implementation was pre-existing
