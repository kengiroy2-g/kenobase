summary:
  - Anti-Cluster Trading Signal requires new AntiClusterStrategy in strategy.py
  - cluster_reset.py already implements core logic (detect_cluster_events, generate_trading_signals)
  - Strategy should filter out numbers with active NO_BET signals from predictions
  - Register new strategy in StrategyFactory for backtest integration
  - Add composite strategy pattern for combining hot_number + anti_cluster filters
  - Export new strategy in pipeline/__init__.py
  - Create unit tests for strategy integration

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-number
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): TradingSignal.signal_type == "NO_BET" excludes number
- Rule 4 (target metric): bet-selection
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_cluster_reset.py -v`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-number
- Semantics: Numbers with active cluster >= threshold get NO_BET signal, excluded from predictions
- Target metric: bet-selection improvement by filtering cluster-active numbers

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_cluster_reset.py -v` -> existing tests pass
