reviewed_handoff: "ki1_TASK_042_ARCHITECT_20251231_030540.md"
summary:
  - Plan is methodologically sound: t-test, bootstrap CI, Cohen's d, Chi2 for proportions
  - All 4 data sources verified (KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv, Keno_GQ_2025.csv, KENO_ab_2018.csv exist)
  - Metrics cited in plan verified against distribution_analysis_2025.json + distribution_analysis_2022_2024.json
  - Granularity correct: per-year comparison (2025 vs 2018-2024 baseline)
  - Acceptance Criteria measurable and appropriate
  - No Known Bugs triggered
  - Script output path clear: results/outlier_year_2025_validation.json
  - WORKING_SET_REQUEST appropriate for EXECUTOR

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-year (2025 vs 2018-2024)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): mean_payout, cv_payout, jackpot_rate, jackpot_interval
- Rule 4 (target metric): statistical significance (p<0.05) + effect size (Cohen's d)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/validate_2025_outlier.py -> results/outlier_year_2025_validation.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-year (2025 vs historical baseline 2018-2024)
- Semantics: mean_daily_payout (daily sum), cv_payout (std/mean), jackpot_10_rate (proportion), jackpot_10_avg_interval (days)
- Target metric: p-value < 0.05 for significance, Cohen's d for practical significance

## Repro Commands
- python scripts/validate_2025_outlier.py -> results/outlier_year_2025_validation.json
