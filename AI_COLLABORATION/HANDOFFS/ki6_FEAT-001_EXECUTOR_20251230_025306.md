status: COMPLETE
task: FEAT-001
role: EXECUTOR
phase: EXECUTOR
files_changed:
  - kenobase/analysis/draw_features.py (NEW - 297 lines)
  - kenobase/analysis/__init__.py (MODIFIED - added exports)
  - tests/unit/test_draw_features.py (NEW - 28 tests)
summary:
  - Created DrawFeatureExtractor class as unified interface for draw feature extraction
  - Implemented 4 features: sum, decade_counts[7], entropy (bits), uniqueness (0-1)
  - DrawFeatures dataclass with to_dict() and to_vector() for serialization/numerical analysis
  - FeatureStatistics for aggregate statistics over feature collections
  - Entropy uses log2 (bits), max ~2.807 for 7 decades
  - Uniqueness defaults to heuristic (numbers >31 = unique), supports custom frequency data
  - All 28 unit tests pass (100%), covering normal cases, edge cases, null model readiness
  - Exports added to __init__.py following existing pattern

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): sum (int), decade_counts (tuple[int,7]), entropy (float, bits), uniqueness (float, 0-1)
- Rule 4 (target metric): Null model comparison via feature vectors
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_draw_features.py -v` -> 28 passed

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw
- Semantics: sum, decade_counts[7], entropy, uniqueness
- Target metric: Feature vectors for NullModelRunner comparison

## Repro Commands
- `python -c "from kenobase.analysis.draw_features import DrawFeatureExtractor; print('OK')"` -> OK
- `pytest tests/unit/test_draw_features.py -v` -> 28 passed
