summary:
  - AI_COLLABORATION/SYSTEM_STATUS.json missing; mandatory context read failed (requires location/creation).
  - HYP_012 measures overlap_count=|draw_t INTERSECT draw_{t-1}| and overlap_birthday_ratio from scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py using KENO draws + phase labeling.
  - results/overlap_statistics.json (global_distribution.mean, N=1457 draws) from `python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py` shows mean 5.745 vs expected 5.714 (z=0.69, p=0.49) - no significant bias.
  - results/overlap_statistics.json (by_phase.* overlap/birthday z-scores, Bonferroni alpha=0.0033, same command) reports PRE/POST/COOLDOWN/NORMAL all non-significant.
  - Data sources: data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv for numbers; data/processed/ecosystem/timeline_2025.csv for phase tagging in analyze_cycles_comprehensive pipeline.
  - CURRENT_STATUS.md untouched per policy; this handoff records planning only.

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): UNVERIFIED (SYSTEM_STATUS.json not found under AI_COLLABORATION)
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (phase-stratified checks)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): overlap_count=|numbers_t INTERSECT numbers_{t-1}|, overlap_birthday_ratio=birthday_overlap/overlap_count, phases in {PRE_JACKPOT, POST_JACKPOT, COOLDOWN, NORMAL}
- Rule 4 (target metric): accuracy (deviation vs hypergeometric expectation)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py -> results/overlap_statistics.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (phase-stratified as needed)
- Semantics: overlap_count and overlap_birthday_ratio between consecutive draws; expected mean from hypergeometric(70,20,20)
- Target metric: accuracy (observed vs expected overlap distribution)

## Repro Commands
- python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py -> results/overlap_statistics.json

# Implementierungsplan
- Confirm HYP_012 hypothesis wording and null: overlap_count between consecutive draws vs hypergeometric expectation (mean 5.714); clarify effect direction and alpha (Bonferroni/BH) per AXIOM-FIRST ADR.
- Validate data pipeline: ensure `data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv` completeness, phase labels from `data/processed/ecosystem/timeline_2025.csv`, and overlap derivation (`overlap_with_prev`, birthday split) in scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py handle first-row NaN and date parsing.
- Reproduce baseline metrics by running `python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py`; verify global histogram, z-scores, per-phase Mann-Whitney/Kruskal-Wallis outputs, and confirm artifacts `results/overlap_statistics.json` + `results/cycles_comprehensive_analysis.json`.
- Deepen HYP_012 test: compute theoretical distribution (hypergeometric or simulation) with confidence intervals; assess per-phase deltas and effect sizes; add lag-k sensitivity (e.g., overlaps vs draw t-7/28) if hypothesis implies persistence; include multiple-testing correction.
- Reporting/acceptance: document conclusion (significant/non-significant) with N, p, and effect sizes; note data boundaries/assumptions; stage updated artifacts and handoff; plan CURRENT_STATUS update once reporting phase allows.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Repro command above regenerates overlap stats without errors and writes results/overlap_statistics.json + cycles_comprehensive_analysis.json.
- Hypothesis statement, null expectation, and test direction explicitly documented with hypergeometric baseline and alpha/adjustment.
- Results reported with N, mean/CI, p-values per phase/global; any significance flagged post-correction.
- Edge handling (first draw, missing dates/phases, zero-overlap cases) and data sources documented.
- Handoff updated to reflect plan; CURRENT_STATUS update path defined for next phase.
