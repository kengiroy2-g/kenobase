phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_HOUSE-003_ARCHITECT_20251228_204205.md"
summary:
  - Plan is mechanically complete with clear file structure and acceptance criteria
  - StakeDrawRecord reuse is valid - contains restbetrag and total_auszahlung fields (stake_correlation.py:111-132)
  - CV calculation (std/mean) is mathematically correct for stability measurement
  - Rolling windows 7/14/30 days are reasonable for detecting operational patterns
  - Threshold CV < 15% is falsifiable and measurable
  - Data source (769 records) provides sufficient data for 30-day windows (~25 windows)
  - No global-vs-specific threshold conflict (BUG-001 not applicable - this is global Keno analysis)
  - WORKING_SET_REQUEST is appropriate for executor needs

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (daily rolling windows across all draws)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): CV = std(restbetrag)/mean(restbetrag) over 7/14/30 day windows
- Rule 4 (target metric): stability (CV < 0.15 indicates active payout control)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (new module, no orchestrator needed)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_house003.py` -> results/house003_rolling_stability.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (daily rolling windows)
- Semantics: CV = Coefficient of Variation = std/mean of restbetrag over rolling windows
- Target metric: CV < 0.15 indicates active payout control (STABLE classification)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_house003.py` -> results/house003_rolling_stability.json
