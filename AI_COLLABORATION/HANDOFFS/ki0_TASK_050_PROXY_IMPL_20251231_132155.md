summary:
  - Script analyze_typ7_highwin.py passes syntax check (py_compile)
  - Output typ7_highwin_forensik.json is valid JSON
  - N=3 events correctly identified (2018-06-18, 2020-07-21, 2023-04-16)
  - Birthday ratio mean 0.45 correctly computed from [0.5, 0.5, 0.35]
  - Typ-6 comparison included as baseline (N=11)
  - Caveat about small N prominently noted in output
  - No integration points affected (standalone forensik script)
  - No Known Bugs triggered (no global thresholds, no config changes)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-keno-type (Typ-7)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): Typ-7 = 7 numbers, 7/7 hits = 1.000 EUR payout
- Rule 4 (target metric): descriptive forensik (frequency, birthday-ratio, weekday)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (standalone script, no pipeline integration)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_typ7_highwin.py` -> `results/typ7_highwin_forensik.json`

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_typ7_highwin.py` -> `results/typ7_highwin_forensik.json`

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

**APPROVED** - Implementation is correct and complete.

## Verification Summary
- Syntax: OK (py_compile passes)
- JSON: Valid
- Data: 3 Typ-7 events correctly filtered
- Math: Birthday ratio 0.45 = (0.5 + 0.5 + 0.35)/3 verified
- Caveats: Small N prominently noted
- Integration: None required (standalone script)
- Known Bugs: None triggered
