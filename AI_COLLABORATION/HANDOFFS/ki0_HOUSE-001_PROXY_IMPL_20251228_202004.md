# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): GK1Event, birthday_ratio (1-31), high_ratio (32-70)
- Rule 4 (target metric): correlation (Pearson r, Spearman r, Chi-Quadrat)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_hyp015_jackpot.py` -> `results/hyp015_jackpot_correlation.json`

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_hyp015_jackpot.py` -> `results/hyp015_jackpot_correlation.json`
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_jackpot_correlation.py -v` -> 32 passed

# Proxy Review Summary

**Implementation is APPROVED.** All mechanical, architectural, and integration checks pass.

Key findings:
1. **32/32 tests pass** with expected warnings for edge cases
2. **__init__.py properly extended** with 22 new HYP-015 exports
3. **Module follows odds_correlation.py pattern** - consistent architecture
4. **Results valid**: HYP-015 FALSIFIED (Pearson r=0.017, p=0.65, Chi2 p=0.74)

No known bugs reproduced. Ready for Validator phase.
