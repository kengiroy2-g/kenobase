# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-game
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): date index, {game}_has_draw, {game}_z1..z20
- Rule 4 (target metric): coverage (draw_days/total_days)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_timeline.py -v` -> 24/24 passed

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-game (3 lotteries: KENO, Lotto, EuroJackpot)
- Semantics: Daily aligned grid with {game}_has_draw, {game}_z1..z20 columns
- Target metric: Coverage ratio (draw_days / total_days)

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_timeline.py -v` -> 24 passed in 0.57s
- `python scripts/build_timeline_grid.py --use-defaults` -> data/processed/timeline_grid.parquet
