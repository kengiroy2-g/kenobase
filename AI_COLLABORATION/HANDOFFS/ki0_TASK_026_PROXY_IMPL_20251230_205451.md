summary:
  - Script scripts/walk_forward_yearly_transfer.py (656 lines) syntactically valid
  - Implements frozen-rule transfer matrix: train on Year X, test on Year Y (all 4x4)
  - Correctly reuses position_rule_layer logic (RollingPositionRuleMiner, apply_rule_layer_to_scores)
  - BH/FDR correction implemented correctly for 48 OOS tests (lines 428-461)
  - Output results/yearly_transfer_matrix.json is valid JSON with complete structure
  - Key finding: 0/48 FDR-significant, mean OOS delta_roi=-9.51pp (rules hurt vs baseline)
  - Axiom-First compliance: frozen rules, OOS testing, multiple-comparison correction
  - No architecture violations or integration issues detected

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-year-pair
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): train_year, test_year, delta_roi, fdr_significant, rules_roi, baseline_roi
- Rule 4 (target metric): generalization (ROI transfer stability across year-pairs)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/walk_forward_yearly_transfer.py --output results/yearly_transfer_matrix.json` -> results/yearly_transfer_matrix.json

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/walk_forward_yearly_transfer.py --output results/yearly_transfer_matrix.json`

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

## Verification Summary
| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Syntax (py_compile) | PASS |
| JSON validity | PASS |
| BH/FDR implementation | CORRECT (lines 428-461) |
| Frozen rules | CORRECT (lines 175-188) |
| Import paths | CORRECT |
| Output structure | COMPLETE |

## Key Finding
The transfer matrix analysis correctly shows **position rules do NOT generalize across years**:
- Mean OOS delta_roi = **-9.51pp** (rules hurt vs baseline)
- 0/48 tests FDR-significant
- Clear overfitting: in-sample +30-300pp vs OOS negative

This is a **methodologically sound negative result** that validates the Axiom-First approach.
