status: APPROVED
task: TASK_052
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_IMPL
reviewed_handoff: "ki2_TASK_052_EXECUTOR_20251231_135456.md"
summary:
  - Script syntax valid (py_compile passed)
  - JSON output valid and well-structured
  - All probability calculations verified mathematically correct
  - Typ-9 events = 0 correctly identified from high_win_forensik.json
  - Poisson null hypothesis test correctly implemented
  - Baseline comparison (Typ-6, Typ-7) included for context
  - Minor issue: Docstring line 11 claims P(9/9)=2.51e-07 but code computes 2.58e-06 (code is correct)
  - Acceptance criteria met: output file exists with theoretical bounds documented

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-ticket-type (Typ-9)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): keno_type=9, 8/9=1000 EUR, 9/9=50000 EUR, high_payout_threshold=400 EUR
- Rule 4 (target metric): event_count (observed=0), theoretical probability, null hypothesis test
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (standalone analysis script, no core module changes)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/analyze_typ9_highwin.py -> results/typ9_highwin_forensik.json VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-ticket-type (Typ-9)
- Semantics: P(8/9), P(9/9), expected_events, p_zero_events (Poisson), draws_analyzed
- Target metric: Null-Result documentation with theoretical bounds

## Repro Commands
- python scripts/analyze_typ9_highwin.py -> results/typ9_highwin_forensik.json VERIFIED

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

## Verification Summary
All calculations mathematically verified:
- P(8/9) = 9.685e-05 (1 in 10,325 draws)
- P(9/9) = 2.583e-06 (1 in 387,196 draws)
- P(observing 0 | 8/9) = 80.52%
- P(observing 0 | 9/9) = 99.42%

## Conclusion
**APPROVED** - Implementation is correct, mathematically sound. The null-result forensik correctly documents that 0 Typ-9 high-win events is statistically expected.
