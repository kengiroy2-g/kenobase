summary:
  - Validator verified all 14 high-win events (>450 EUR) across 12 unique dates (2018-2024)
  - Birthday ratio 0.4464 matches random baseline (31/70=0.4429) - no exploitable anomaly
  - Permutation test p=0.558 confirms no temporal clustering
  - V1 (8 events) vs V2 (6 events) split validated; sum=14
  - Top performer: typ_6:pair_focused [2,3,9,33,49,50] with 5 events (+52.9% ROI)
  - Weekday distribution: Dienstag=6, Sonntag=3, Donnerstag=2, Montag=2, Samstag=1
  - Repro commands verified and syntactically correct
  - No architecture violations or integration issues detected

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-event
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): date, ticket_id, keno_type, numbers, hits, payout, strategy, weekday, birthday_ratio
- Rule 4 (target metric): forensik pattern analysis (birthday ratio, temporal clustering)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): Commands verified below

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-event
- Semantics: Events with payout >450 EUR (threshold=451)
- Target metric: Birthday ratio anomaly + temporal clustering significance

## Repro Commands
- python scripts/backtest_high_payout_tickets.py --draws "Keno_GPTs/Kenogpts_2/Basis_Tab/KENO_ab_2018.csv" --year 0 --threshold 451 --output results/high_payout_backtest_gt450.json
- python scripts/analyze_high_win_forensik.py --backtest results/high_payout_backtest_gt450.json --draws "Keno_GPTs/Kenogpts_2/Basis_Tab/KENO_ab_2018.csv" --output results/high_win_forensik_gt450.json

# Proxy Final Review

## Validator Coverage Assessment
| Aspect | Covered |
|--------|---------|
| Event count verification | YES (14 events) |
| Date uniqueness | YES (12 dates) |
| Threshold correctness | YES (451 = >450) |
| Birthday ratio calculation | YES (0.4464) |
| Statistical test interpretation | YES (p=0.558) |
| V1/V2 split verification | YES (8+6=14) |
| Schema completeness | YES |

## User Acceptance Criteria
1. **Data Integrity**: All 14 events have complete schemas with date, ticket, hits, payout, weekday, birthday_ratio
2. **Statistical Rigor**: Permutation test with 1000 iterations; p=0.558 correctly interprets as no significant clustering
3. **Actionable Insight**: Top ticket identified (pair_focused with 5 events) for potential strategy focus
4. **Reproducibility**: Commands verified syntactically correct

## Architecture Decision Check
- No new ADRs required
- No breaking changes
- Artifacts follow existing patterns (results/*.json)

## Final Decision

**STATUS: COMPLETE**

The forensik analysis for high-win events >450 EUR is complete with:
- Verified data claims
- Proper statistical methodology
- Clear null result interpretation (no birthday anomaly, no clustering)
- Reproducible workflow

No escalation needed. Task can be marked DONE.
