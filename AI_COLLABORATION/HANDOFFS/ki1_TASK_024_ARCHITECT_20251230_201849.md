summary:
  - HYP_014: Overlap-Autokorrelation tests if overlap_count time series shows temporal dependencies
  - Overlap = Anzahl Zahlen die von Ziehung N-1 zu N wiederholt werden (range 0-20)
  - Existing: results/overlap_statistics.json has overlap by phase (N=1457), mean=5.74
  - Missing: Autocorrelation analysis (lag=1..7), permutation-based p-value, interpretation
  - Test: Pearson autocorrelation at lag=1, expect |r|<0.1 if random
  - Nullmodell: Block-permutation preserving weekly structure
  - Output: results/hyp014_overlap_autocorrelation.json
  - Script: scripts/test_hyp014_overlap_autocorrelation.py
