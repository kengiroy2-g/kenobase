summary:
  - Architecture verified: HypothesisSynthesizer + KenoPredictor both exist and have compatible interfaces
  - Synthesizer outputs NumberScore with combined_score (0-1), ML model outputs probability (0-1) - compatible for weighted ensemble
  - Weights alpha=0.4 (rule) + 0.6 (ml) reasonable given ML typically outperforms rule-based
  - New file kenobase/prediction/ensemble.py - correct location, follows existing module pattern
  - __init__.py exports need update - correctly identified
  - scripts/predict.py needs --ensemble flag - correctly identified
  - Target F1 >= 0.50 from 0.4434 baseline is measurable and reasonable
  - No global threshold issues (BUG-001 not applicable - this is KENO-specific)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-game (KENO 1-70)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): ensemble_score = alpha * synthesizer_score + (1-alpha) * ml_probability
- Rule 4 (target metric): F1 >= 0.50
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/predict.py --ensemble` -> JSON output
