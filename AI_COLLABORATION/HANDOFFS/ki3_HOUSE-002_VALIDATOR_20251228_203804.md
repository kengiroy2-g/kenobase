summary:
  - All 7 unit tests PASSED (TestAnalyzeHighStakePopularityBias class)
  - HighStakePopularityResult dataclass verified (frozen=True, 9 fields, lines 701-725)
  - analyze_high_stake_popularity_bias() function verified (lines 728-871)
  - Analysis script runs successfully: 365 draws, r=0.024, p=0.64
  - Output JSON valid and matches acceptance criteria structure
  - Module exports verified (HighStakePopularityResult, analyze_high_stake_popularity_bias in __all__)
  - Hypothesis result: NOT SUPPORTED (no significant correlation)
  - Reproducibility confirmed via `python scripts/analyze_house002.py`

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): high_stake = 75th percentile (377,154 EUR); unpopular = below-median popularity
- Rule 4 (target metric): Spearman |r| > 0.15 with p < 0.05
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_house002.py` -> `results/house002_stake_popularity.json` VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw
- Semantics: high_stake_threshold = 75th percentile; unpopular_ratio = count(below-median popularity) / 20
- Target metric: Spearman correlation

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_house002.py` -> `results/house002_stake_popularity.json` VERIFIED
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_stake_correlation.py::TestAnalyzeHighStakePopularityBias -v` -> 7/7 PASSED

# Validation

**Tests:** 7/7 PASSED  
**Script:** Reproducible, output matches expected structure  
**Code Quality:** Proper typing, edge-case handling, immutable dataclass  
**Hypothesis Result:** NOT SUPPORTED (r=0.024, p=0.64)
