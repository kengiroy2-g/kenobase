status: COMPLETE
task: HOUSE-004
role: ARCHITECT
phase: ARCHITECT
files_changed: []
summary:
  - Near-Miss analysis module exists at kenobase/analysis/near_miss.py
  - Jackpot correlation module exists at kenobase/analysis/jackpot_correlation.py
  - GK1 data available at Keno_GPTs/10-9_KGDaten_gefiltert.csv (jackpot events)
  - New module required: kenobase/analysis/near_miss_jackpot.py to combine both analyses
  - New script required: scripts/analyze_house004.py for CLI interface
  - Test file required: tests/unit/test_near_miss_jackpot.py
  - Hypothesis: Near-Miss frequency differs between high-jackpot and normal periods

**Handoff written to:** `AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki1_HOUSE-004_ARCHITECT_20251228_205505.md`

**Key Implementation Points:**
1. Create `kenobase/analysis/near_miss_jackpot.py` combining near_miss + jackpot_correlation
2. Segment GQ data by jackpot/non-jackpot dates using GK1 events
3. Calculate Near-Miss ratio for both segments
4. Chi-square test for significance
5. CLI script at `scripts/analyze_house004.py`
6. Unit tests at `tests/unit/test_near_miss_jackpot.py`
