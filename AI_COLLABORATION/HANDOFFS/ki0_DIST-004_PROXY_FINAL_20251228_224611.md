status: COMPLETE
task: DIST-004
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - All 31 tests pass (pytest tests/unit/test_popularity_correlation.py -v)
  - BirthdayCorrelationResult dataclass verified at line 472 with correct fields
  - calculate_birthday_score() at line 494 correctly computes 1-31 fraction
  - correlate_birthday_with_winners() at line 509 implements rolling-window stability (Law A)
  - __all__ exports 13 items including new birthday-correlation functions (line 648-663)
  - CLI script handles NO_DATA gracefully when GQ files unavailable
  - results/popularity_proxy.json correctly reports INCONCLUSIVE status
  - Implementation is self-contained, no integration breaking changes

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): birthday_score (0-1 fraction of 1-31 numbers), winners (GQ sum), Spearman r
- Rule 4 (target metric): correlation r > 0.3 with p < 0.05
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_popularity_correlation.py -v` -> 31 passed (1.00s)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw
- Semantics: birthday_score (fraction of numbers in 1-31 range), winners (sum of GQ winners), Spearman correlation
- Target metric: r > 0.3 with p < 0.05 supports hypothesis

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_popularity_correlation.py -v` -> 31 passed (1.00s)
- `python scripts/analyze_popularity_proxy.py --help` -> CLI functional
- `python scripts/analyze_popularity_proxy.py` -> results/popularity_proxy.json (NO_DATA expected without GQ files)

# Proxy Final Review

## Validator Coverage Assessment
1. **Tests**: All 31 tests verified, including 10 new birthday-correlation tests
2. **Syntax**: popularity_correlation.py and analyze_popularity_proxy.py both syntax-OK
3. **Line References**: Verified lines 472, 494, 509, 648-663 match expected content
4. **Exports**: 13 items in __all__ list, correctly includes new functions
5. **Edge Cases**: NO_DATA handling verified via results/popularity_proxy.json

## User Acceptance Criteria
1. **Functionality**: Birthday-score correlation analysis implemented as specified
2. **Law A Integration**: Rolling-window stability test implements Model Law A
3. **CLI Usability**: --help works, graceful handling of missing data
4. **Test Coverage**: 10 new tests specifically for birthday correlation feature
5. **No Breaking Changes**: Module is additive, existing functions unchanged

## Final Decision

**VERDICT: COMPLETE**

Task DIST-004 (Regionale Daten Erweiterung - Birthday Correlation) is fully implemented. No escalation needed.
