status: COMPLETE
task: STATE-001
role: ARCHITECT
phase: ARCHITECT
files_changed: []
summary:
  - Design Regime/State Detection module using Change-Point detection + HMM
  - Integrate with existing EconomicState (kenobase/core/economic_state.py)
  - Use ruptures for change-point detection, hmmlearn for Hidden Markov Models
  - Two-stage approach - Change-points segment data, HMM labels regimes
  - Target output - per-draw state labels (COOLDOWN/HOT/RECOVERY/NORMAL)
  - Validation - Train/Test split per axioms.py protocol
  - New file - kenobase/analysis/regime_detection.py
  - Config section - economic_state + new regime_detection block

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw (daily)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): state_label in {COOLDOWN, HOT, RECOVERY, NORMAL}
- Rule 4 (target metric): bet-selection (avoid COOLDOWN, prefer HOT)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/validate_regime_detection.py
