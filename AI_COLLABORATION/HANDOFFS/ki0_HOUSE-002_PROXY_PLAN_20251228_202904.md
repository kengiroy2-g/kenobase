status: APPROVED
task: HOUSE-002
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_HOUSE-002_ARCHITECT_20251228_202604.md"
summary:
  - Plan combines existing stake_correlation.py + popularity_correlation.py
  - Both data files verified: KENO_ab_2018.csv + Keno_Ziehung2023_+_Restbetrag_v2.CSV exist
  - Acceptance criteria clear: |r| > 0.15 with p < 0.05 for high-stake subset
  - Granularity per-draw is correct for this analysis
  - New function analyze_high_stake_popularity_bias() uses existing infrastructure
  - Output path results/house002_stake_popularity.json follows conventions
  - Unit tests extend existing tests/unit/test_stake_correlation.py
  - No architecture conflicts detected

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): high_stake = top 25%; unpopular = below-median popularity
- Rule 4 (target metric): Spearman r correlation
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_house002.py` -> `results/house002_stake_popularity.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw
- Semantics: high_stake = top 25% by Spieleinsatz; unpopular = below-median popularity
- Target metric: Spearman correlation with p < 0.05

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_house002.py` -> `results/house002_stake_popularity.json`

# Proxy Review

## Key Verifications
1. **Data Files Exist**:
   - `Keno_GPTs/Keno_Ziehung2023_+_Restbetrag_v2.CSV` ✓
   - `data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2018.csv` ✓

2. **Module Compatibility**: Both stake_correlation.py and popularity_correlation.py use Spearman correlation via scipy.stats.spearmanr

3. **No Red Flags**:
   - No global thresholds (top 25% is relative)
   - No cross-team issues (KENO-only analysis)
   - Existing infrastructure reused
