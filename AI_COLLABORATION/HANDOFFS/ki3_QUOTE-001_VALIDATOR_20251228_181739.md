summary:
  - Document docs/keno_quotes.md NOT corrected since last validation
  - ROI errors confirmed in 8/9 KENO types (only Typ 10 correct)
  - Typ 7 has worst error at -23.91pp (doc 25.66%, correct 49.57%)
  - Typ 8 error -21.94pp (doc 21.31%, correct 43.25%)
  - Probability odds errors: Typ 8/8 (3.07x), Typ 7/7 (2.65x)
  - Types 2-8 systematically underestimate ROI
  - Type 9 overestimates by +6.36pp
  - ACTION REQUIRED: Return to EXECUTOR for complete recalculation

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-keno-type (Types 2-10)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): ROI = sum(P(k)*Quote(k)), P(k) = C(20,k)*C(50,n-k)/C(70,n)
- Rule 4 (target metric): mathematical accuracy
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -c "..."` command in handoff file

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-keno-type
- Semantics: Hypergeometric probability for KENO draws
- Target metric: Mathematical accuracy

## Repro Commands
- See handoff file for full Python verification command

# Validation

**Result: REJECTED**

The document `docs/keno_quotes.md` has NOT been corrected since the previous validation. All errors persist:

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| AC2 (probabilities) | FAILED |
| AC4 (ROI values) | FAILED |

**Key Findings:**
- 8/9 KENO types have incorrect ROI values
- Errors range from -24pp to +6pp
- Only Typ 10 is mathematically correct
- Document claims Typ 9 is best (56.41%) - actually average (50.05%)
- Document claims Typ 8 is worst (21.31%) - actually 43.25%
