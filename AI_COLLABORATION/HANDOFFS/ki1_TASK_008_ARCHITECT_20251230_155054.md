# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-year (phase = year)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): YearlyFrequencyResult(year, number, absolute_frequency, relative_frequency, total_draws)
- Rule 4 (target metric): frequency stability (Axiom A5 validation)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (no new code needed)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_frequency_per_year.py` -> `results/frequency_per_year.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-year
- Semantics: YearlyFrequencyResult dataclass with year, number, absolute_frequency, relative_frequency, total_draws
- Target metric: Year-over-Year stability analysis for Axiom A5 validation

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_frequency_per_year.py` -> `results/frequency_per_year.json`
- `pytest tests/unit/test_frequency_per_year.py -v` -> all 12 tests pass

# Implementierungsplan

## Status: ALREADY DONE

TASK_008 "Zahlenfrequenz pro Phase" has been fully implemented in prior work:

### 1. Core Module (kenobase/analysis/frequency.py)

| Component | Lines | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `YearlyFrequencyResult` | 379-396 | Frozen dataclass for per-year frequency |
| `calculate_frequency_per_year()` | 398-483 | Groups draws by year, calculates frequency per number |

### 2. CLI Script (scripts/analyze_frequency_per_year.py)

- Loads KENO data from CSV
- Calculates per-year frequencies for numbers 1-70
- Outputs JSON with metadata, yearly_frequencies, and summary statistics
- Default input: `data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv`
- Default output: `results/frequency_per_year.json`

### 3. Results (results/frequency_per_year.json)

Current data:
- Source: KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv
- Total draws: 1457
- Years covered: 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025
- Number range: 1-70

### 4. Unit Tests (tests/unit/test_frequency_per_year.py)

12 test cases covering:
- Empty input handling
- Single/multiple years
- Multiple draws same year
- number_range initialization
- Invalid range validation
- KENO full range (1-70)
- Count consistency
- Sorting

## Acceptance Criteria

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Function calculates per-year frequency | DONE |
| Dataclass stores year, number, abs/rel freq | DONE |
| CLI script runnable | DONE |
| JSON output generated | DONE |
| Unit tests pass | DONE |
| number_range param works | DONE |

## Recommendation

Mark TASK_008 as **DONE** - no further implementation needed.
