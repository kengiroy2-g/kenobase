status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_013
role: ARCHITECT
phase: ARCHITECT
files_changed: []
summary:
  - CORRECTED: Renamed from "HYP_003" to "Weekday-ROI Analysis" (avoids HYP-003 conflict)
  - Script: scripts/analyze_weekday_roi.py (NOT analyze_hyp003_weekday.py)
  - Output: results/weekday_roi_analysis.json (NOT hyp003_weekday_effect.json)
  - REUSE existing temporal_cycles.analyze_dimension() for Chi-square (no reimplementation)
  - NEW CODE ONLY: ROI stratification by weekday using V2-Tickets backtest
  - Nullmodell: Weekday-preserving shuffle (compare shuffled draws within same weekday)
  - Acceptance: ROI_diff >= 20% between best/worst weekday OR p<0.05 Chi-square
  - Data: KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv (348+ draws, sufficient for 7-weekday stratification)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (per-weekday, 7 categories)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): weekday=0-6 (Monday-Sunday), ROI per weekday for V2-Tickets
- Rule 4 (target metric): ROI stratification (primary), Chi-square p-value (secondary)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_weekday_roi.py` -> `results/weekday_roi_analysis.json`

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_weekday_roi.py` -> `results/weekday_roi_analysis.json`
