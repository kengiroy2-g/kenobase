status: COMPLETE
task: COUPLE-002
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - All 23 unit tests pass (2.61s) - verified independently in final review
  - CLI fully functional with all parameters for KENO/Lotto/EuroJackpot analysis
  - 8 public symbols correctly exported from kenobase.analysis
  - EuroJackpot correctly treated as negative control per CLAUDE.md section 1.2
  - BH/FDR correction applied per-band for multiple testing control
  - Architecture matches plan: CPSD/coherence via scipy.signal, phase-randomized and block surrogates
  - No user-escalation needed: implementation follows existing patterns
  - Task ready for commit/merge

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-market (lottery pair + representation + frequency band)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): CPSD/coherence/phase-lag per FrequencyBand, BH-corrected q-values
- Rule 4 (target metric): accuracy (correct detection of inverse/periodic coupling with FDR control)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_cross_spectrum_coupling.py -v` -> 23 passed in 2.61s

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-market (lottery pair + representation + frequency band)
- Semantics: Cross-spectrum coherence + PLV per FrequencyBand, BH-corrected q-values
- Target metric: accuracy (correct detection of inverse/periodic coupling with FDR control)

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_cross_spectrum_coupling.py -v` -> 23 passed in 2.61s
- `python scripts/analyze_cross_spectrum_coupling.py --help` -> shows CLI options
- `python -c "from kenobase.analysis import analyze_spectral_coupling; print('OK')"` -> import verified

# Proxy Final Review

**COMPLETE** - Task COUPLE-002 (Cross-Spectrum Coupling Analysis) is fully implemented, tested, and ready for production.
