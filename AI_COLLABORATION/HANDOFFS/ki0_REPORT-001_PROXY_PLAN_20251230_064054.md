status: APPROVED
task: REPORT-001
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki5_REPORT-001_ARCHITECT_20251230_063854.md"
summary:
  - Plan is well-structured: 4 phases (Inventory, Repro Docs, Reports, Validation)
  - 92 JSON artifacts confirmed in results/ (count verified)
  - Existing report.py supports BacktestResult format only (confirmed: requires backtest_timestamp, summary, period_results)
  - Plan correctly identifies jq/simple dump for non-BacktestResult artifacts
  - 6 repro commands documented, all cite existing scripts in scripts/
  - Working Set Request is appropriate (5 files, key artifacts + scripts)
  - Acceptance Criteria measurable: REPRO_COMMANDS.md exists, 5+ documented, JSON validity
  - No architecture changes, no new dependencies - low risk

- Rule 6 (reproducibility): 5/6 commands VERIFIED, 1 UNVERIFIED (super_model_synthesis.py)
