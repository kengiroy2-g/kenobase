status: APPROVED
task: ECO-001
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki5_ECO-001_ARCHITECT_20251230_052451.md"
summary:
  - Plan is complete with clear deliverables and acceptance criteria
  - Edge criterion (q_value < 0.05 AND lift > 1.1 OR alt-method significant) is well-defined
  - Correctly uses existing cross_lottery_coupling.json and alternative_coupling.py
  - NetworkX-compatible output format is sensible for graph operations
  - EuroJackpot as separate node aligns with CLAUDE.md ecosystem separation
  - Repro command clear: python scripts/build_ecosystem_graph.py
  - No global thresholds misapplied (edge thresholds are FDR-corrected, appropriate)
  - Tests specified: tests/unit/test_ecosystem_graph.py

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-game-pair
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): nodes=games, edges=robust couplings (q<0.05, lift>1.1)
- Rule 4 (target metric): FDR q-value + edge weight
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/build_ecosystem_graph.py` -> `results/ecosystem_graph.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-game-pair
- Semantics: 6 games as nodes, significant couplings as edges
- Target metric: FDR q-value < 0.05

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/build_ecosystem_graph.py` -> `results/ecosystem_graph.json`

# Proxy Review
