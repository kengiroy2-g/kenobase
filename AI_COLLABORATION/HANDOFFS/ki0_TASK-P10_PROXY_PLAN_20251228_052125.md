status: APPROVED
task: TASK-P10
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_TASK-P10_ARCHITECT_20251228_051825.md"
summary:
  - Plan covers core requirements: storage, tracking, comparison, CLI
  - Storage location results/predictions/ aligns with existing results/ pattern
  - Integration with predict.py and DataLoader is correct approach
  - draw_id as reference key enables comparison against actuals
  - Metrics (hit_rate, precision, tier_accuracy) are appropriate for KENO
  - JSON storage format consistent with existing output patterns
  - Missing: Explicit draw_id generation strategy (date-based or sequence?)
  - Recommendation: Proceed with execution, clarify draw_id in implementation

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): UNVERIFIED (status files not found, git status confirmed)
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-prediction
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): hit_rate, precision, tier_accuracy
- Rule 4 (target metric): accuracy
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): UNVERIFIED (new feature)

## Proxy Review

**APPROVED** - The ARCHITECT's plan is architecturally sound:

1. **Mechanisch:** All components defined (storage.py, track_predictions.py, tests)
2. **Architektur:** Consistent with kenobase/prediction/ patterns, no ADR conflicts
3. **Integration:** predict.py, data_loader.py, report.py correctly identified
4. **Konzeptionell:** No known bug patterns (BUG-001/003) apply

**Implementation Notes for EXECUTOR:**
- draw_id: Use YYYYMMDD format for date-based indexing
- Storage path: results/predictions/PRED-{draw_id}-{seq}.json
- Metrics: hit_rate = intersection(predicted, actual) / len(predicted)
