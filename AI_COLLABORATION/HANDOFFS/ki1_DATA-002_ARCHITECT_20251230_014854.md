status: COMPLETE
task: DATA-002
role: ARCHITECT
phase: ARCHITECT
files_changed: []
summary:
  - Task DATA-002 analyzes "Zahlenraum-Normalisierung" for cross-lottery analysis
  - KENO uses 1-70 (20 drawn), Lotto uses 1-49 (6 drawn), EuroJackpot uses 1-50 (5 drawn)
  - Normalization needed for cross-game comparisons and correlation analysis
  - Proposed normalizer module in kenobase/core/normalizer.py
  - Two strategies: percentile-based and domain-specific transformation
  - data_loader.py already provides unified DrawResult model (Line 47-80)
  - Config already has game ranges in config/default.yaml (Line 131-158)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-game (KENO, Lotto, EuroJackpot have different ranges)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): numbers field in DrawResult normalized to [0.0, 1.0] range
- Rule 4 (target metric): cross-lottery correlation analysis enablement
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): pytest tests/unit/test_normalizer.py -v -> Pass/Fail or UNVERIFIED

## Next Phase
EXECUTOR should implement `kenobase/core/normalizer.py` with:
- `normalize_number(n, game)` - single number to [0.0, 1.0]
- `denormalize_number(norm, game)` - back to original range
- `normalize_draw(draw)` - DrawResult integration
- `normalize_numbers(numbers, game)` - batch normalization
