reviewed_handoff: "ki2_HOUSE-002_EXECUTOR_20251228_203104.md"
summary:
  - HighStakePopularityResult dataclass correctly implemented (frozen=True, 9 fields)
  - analyze_high_stake_popularity_bias() function implemented lines 728-871
  - Uses popularity_correlation.calculate_popularity_scores_heuristic() for popularity (lazy import)
  - 7 unit tests all pass (TestAnalyzeHighStakePopularityBias class)
  - Analysis script correctly runs: 365 draws, r=0.024, p=0.64, NOT SUPPORTED
  - Output JSON valid and matches acceptance criteria structure
  - No integration conflicts: standalone analysis combining existing modules
  - Exports added to __all__ (line 879)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): high_stake = top 25%; unpopular = below-median popularity
- Rule 4 (target metric): Spearman |r| > 0.15 with p < 0.05
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_house002.py` -> `results/house002_stake_popularity.json` VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw
- Semantics: high_stake = 75th percentile (377,154 EUR); unpopular_ratio = count below-median / 20
- Target metric: Spearman correlation

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_house002.py` -> `results/house002_stake_popularity.json` VERIFIED
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_stake_correlation.py::TestAnalyzeHighStakePopularityBias -v` -> 7/7 PASSED

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

**APPROVED** - Implementation is mechanically complete, architecturally consistent, and integration-safe. Hypothesis HOUSE-002 tested with result: NOT SUPPORTED (r=0.024, p=0.64). No significant correlation between stake amount and unpopular number ratio detected.
