summary:
  - Script backtest_birthday_cooldown.py created - Python syntax VERIFIED
  - V1/V2 Tickets correctly copied from source scripts (line refs accurate)
  - Mann-Whitney U test used correctly (one-sided, alternative='greater' for V2>V1)
  - JSON output valid (126KB, 11 jackpots, proper structure)
  - Conclusion TREND_V2_BETTER accurate: avg +1.84% diff, 0/5 significant tests
  - Acceptance NOT met as documented (p<0.05 AND V2>V1 required)
  - No BUG-001 triggered - KENO-specific test with correct semantics
  - No integration issues - standalone hypothesis test script

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-ticket-type (Typ 6-10) x Strategie (V1 vs V2)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): V1=OPTIMAL_TICKETS, V2=BIRTHDAY_AVOIDANCE_TICKETS_V2, Cooldown=30d post-GK10_10
- Rule 4 (target metric): ROI-Differenz V2 vs V1 im Cooldown, p<0.05
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/backtest_birthday_cooldown.py` -> `results/hyp005_birthday_cooldown.json` VERIFIED

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/backtest_birthday_cooldown.py` -> `results/hyp005_birthday_cooldown.json`

# Proxy Review Result

**APPROVED** - Implementation is mechanically correct, architecturally sound, and properly documents that HYP_005 acceptance criteria were NOT met. The hypothesis shows a weak trend (V2 better in 3/5 types, avg +1.84%) but lacks statistical significance (0/5 tests with p<0.05).
