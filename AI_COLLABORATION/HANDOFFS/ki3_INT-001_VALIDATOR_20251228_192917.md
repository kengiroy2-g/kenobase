# Validation

**Task INT-001 APPROVED.** Pipeline is fully implemented with Physics Layer integration:
- Model Law A (Stability): `runner.py:342`
- Model Law B (Least-Action): `least_action.py` via PipelineSelector
- Model Law C (Criticality): `runner.py:361`
- Avalanche Analysis: `runner.py:368-385`
