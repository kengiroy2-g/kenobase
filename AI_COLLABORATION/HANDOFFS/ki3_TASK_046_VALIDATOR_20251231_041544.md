summary:
  - VERIFIED: Changelog entry at HYPOTHESES_CATALOG.md:646-652 documents reconciliation correctly
  - VERIFIED: Frequency strategy avg_roi = +30.93% (12 iterations, matches documented +30.9%)
  - VERIFIED: Outlier iteration 11 (+1037.78% ROI) correctly flagged as 8-hit high-win
  - VERIFIED: walk_forward_lookback_grid.json: ALL 35 comparisons have delta_roi = 0.0
  - VERIFIED: FDR correction: 0/35 significant (fdr_significant_count=0, alpha=0.1)
  - VERIFIED: Scripts syntax-checked: analyze_ticket_lifecycle.py + walk_forward_lookback_grid.py
  - SEMANTIC DISTINCTION CORRECT: avg_roi (absolute) vs delta_roi (improvement over baseline)
  - ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA MET: Documentation-only change, no code modifications required

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-strategy (frequency, frequency_high, v2_style) + per-type (Typ-6 to Typ-10)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): avg_roi (absolute ROI %), delta_roi (rules_roi - baseline_roi)
- Rule 4 (target metric): Documentation reconciliation
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_ticket_lifecycle.py` -> `results/ticket_lifecycle_analysis.json` VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-strategy + per-keno-type
- Semantics: avg_roi (absolute), delta_roi (improvement over baseline)
- Target metric: Documentation reconciliation

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_ticket_lifecycle.py` -> `results/ticket_lifecycle_analysis.json`
- `python scripts/walk_forward_lookback_grid.py` -> `results/walk_forward_lookback_grid.json`

# Validation

**APPROVED** - All acceptance criteria met. Key validations:

1. **Mean ROI Verified**: Calculated +30.93% from 12 iterations matches documented +30.9%
2. **Outlier Correctly Noted**: Iteration 11 with +1037.78% (8-hit/1000 EUR win) drives the average
3. **Position Rules Verified**: ALL 35 delta_roi = 0.0 (rules provide no improvement over baseline)
4. **FDR Verified**: fdr_significant_count=0 in JSON summary
5. **Scripts Compile**: Both scripts pass `py_compile`
