status: APPROVED
task: TASK_054
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_TASK_054_ARCHITECT_20251231_142058.md"
summary:
  - Plan is mechanically complete with clear A->B->C->D phases
  - Granularity correctly per-keno-type (Typ-6..10)
  - Reuses existing forensik JSON files as data source - no re-computation
  - Typ-9/10 null-results correctly handled (statistically expected absence)
  - Working set contains all required source files
  - Output path results/cross_type_highwin_comparison.json is consistent with project structure
  - No global threshold issue (BUG-001) - descriptive comparison only
  - Template script analyze_typ7_highwin.py provides clean pattern to follow

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-keno-type (Typ-6 through Typ-10)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): birthday_ratio, weekday, strategy, payout, hits, events_count
- Rule 4 (target metric): descriptive comparison (exploratory, no ROI optimization)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (standalone script, no module changes)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_cross_type_highwin.py` -> `results/cross_type_highwin_comparison.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-keno-type (Typ-6, Typ-7, Typ-8, Typ-9, Typ-10)
- Semantics: events_count, birthday_ratio, weekday, strategy, payout, null_hypothesis
- Target metric: descriptive comparison

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_cross_type_highwin.py` -> `results/cross_type_highwin_comparison.json`

# Proxy Review

**APPROVED** - Plan is well-structured and ready for executor.
