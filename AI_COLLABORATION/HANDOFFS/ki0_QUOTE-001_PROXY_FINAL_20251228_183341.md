status: COMPLETE
task: QUOTE-001
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - Document docs/keno_quotes.md fully validated and mathematically correct
  - Hypergeometric formula P(k|n) = C(n,k)*C(70-n,20-k)/C(70,20) verified at line 34
  - All 9 KENO types (2-10) have correct ROI calculations
  - Summary table (lines 274-284) consistent with detailed sections
  - Best ROI: Typ 3 (50.68%), Worst ROI: Typ 8 (43.25%)
  - AC2 (Probabilities) PASS, AC4 (ROI) PASS
  - No architectural decisions or escalation needed
  - Document ready for production use

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-keno-type (Types 2-10)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): P(k|n) = C(n,k)*C(70-n,20-k)/C(70,20), ROI = sum(P(k)*Quote(k))
- Rule 4 (target metric): mathematical accuracy (tolerance <1pp)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): Validator provided Python verification commands

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-keno-type
- Semantics: Hypergeometric probability for KENO draws (20 from 70)
- Target metric: Mathematical accuracy within 0.01pp

## Repro Commands
- Validator handoff contains Python verification: `python -c "from math import comb; ..."`

# Proxy Final Review

**Validator Coverage:** Complete - all 9 KENO types verified for formula, probabilities, ROI, and summary consistency.

**User Perspective:** Document provides complete KENO quote reference with:
- Mathematically verified calculations
- Clear structure with source references
- Strategic recommendations

**Escalation Check:** None required - pure documentation task, no architectural decisions.

## Final Decision: COMPLETE
