# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-number
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): SHAP values = feature contribution to prediction
- Rule 4 (target metric): interpretability (correlation >= 0.7 with native)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_explainability.py -v` -> 15 passed in 3.12s

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_explainability.py -v` -> 15 passed in 3.12s
