summary:
  - SYSTEM_STATUS.json not found; baseline state UNVERIFIED; git status captured.
  - ADR_PREDICTION_MODEL.md reviewed to align report with hypothesis synthesis architecture.
  - Detailed implementation plan drafted for Hypothesen-Ergebnisse Report covering inputs, processing, reporting, QA.
  - Working set request issued for hypotheses catalog and result artifacts; CURRENT_STATUS unchanged.

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): UNVERIFIED (SYSTEM_STATUS.json missing; ADR_PREDICTION_MODEL.md and git status done)
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (provisional)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): hypothesis result schema UNVERIFIED (needs actual fields from results)
- Rule 4 (target metric): accuracy (provisional; align to F1 target once data inspected)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): UNVERIFIED (awaiting data files and command entrypoints)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (needs confirmation against dataset scope)
- Semantics: hypothesis result fields (id, draw_range, sample_size, p_value, significance, score, support evidence) to be verified from actual outputs
- Target metric: accuracy/F1 focus inferred from ADR_PREDICTION_MODEL.md; confirm with product owner

## Repro Commands
- UNVERIFIED (need report generation entrypoint and data paths)

# Implementierungsplan
- Step 1: Scope & inputs — confirm hypotheses in scope (HYP-007/010/011/012 etc.) via HYPOTHESES_CATALOG; catalog required data files (results/hyp*.json, prediction outputs) and report audience/timespan.
- Step 2: Schema & validation — inspect result JSON schema; define canonical fields (id, timestamp, draw_window, sample_size, significance flags, scores) and validation rules; add missing-field handling.
- Step 3: Aggregation logic — design per-hypothesis summaries (support counts, significance rate, effect estimates), cross-hypothesis comparisons, and links to Synthesizer weights from ADR_PREDICTION_MODEL.md; specify calculations for confidence/criticality if used.
- Step 4: Report structure — outline sections (methodology, data sources with paths, per-hypothesis findings, cross-hyp synthesis, risk/physics notes, recommendations), output format (MD/HTML/JSON) and target location under AI_COLLABORATION/RESULTS.
- Step 5: Tooling & automation — define or extend CLI/script (likely scripts/report.py) to load inputs, run aggregation, render templates; add flags for date ranges and verbosity; ensure reproducibility commands logged.
- Step 6: QA & acceptance — plan validation checks (counts vs. input N, significance thresholds, anti-avalanche compliance), regression check against prior report if available, and verify outputs saved with timestamps.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Report references concrete artifact paths and date ranges for every data claim.
- Per-hypothesis metrics (support N, significance rate, key scores) and cross-hyp synthesis are present and traceable.
- Reproducible command produces the report and writes to agreed output path under AI_COLLABORATION/RESULTS with timestamped filename.
- Validation checks for schema completeness and count consistency pass or clearly flag issues.
