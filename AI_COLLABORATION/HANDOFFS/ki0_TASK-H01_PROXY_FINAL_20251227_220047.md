status: COMPLETE
task: TASK-H01
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - All 38 unit tests PASSED (pytest tests/unit/test_recurrence.py -v in 0.80s)
  - WeeklyCycleResult dataclass implements HYP-006 weekday analysis (lines 107-128)
  - RecurrenceDaysResult dataclass implements 7-day calendar lookback (lines 131-151)
  - analyze_weekly_cycle() correctly calculates recurrence per weekday (lines 445-508)
  - analyze_recurrence_days() correctly uses calendar-day window (lines 511-592)
  - __all__ exports 12 items including 4 new items for HYP-006
  - generate_recurrence_report() extended with weekly_cycle and recurrence_7d sections
  - No breaking changes, clean integration with existing codebase

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): WeeklyCycleResult, RecurrenceDaysResult, days=7
- Rule 4 (target metric): recurrence_rate (pattern-predictability)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_recurrence.py -v` -> 38 PASSED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw (individual lottery draws analyzed)
- Semantics: analyze_weekly_cycle() for weekday patterns, analyze_recurrence_days(days=7) for calendar-day lookback
- Target metric: recurrence_rate (0.0-1.0)

## Repro Commands
- `python -m py_compile kenobase/analysis/recurrence.py` -> Syntax OK
- `pytest tests/unit/test_recurrence.py -v` -> 38 PASSED in 0.80s

# Proxy Final Review

## Validator Coverage Assessment
The Validator verified all critical aspects:
1. Syntax validation (py_compile) - PASS
2. All 38 unit tests including 10 new HYP-006 tests - PASS
3. Dataclass structure (WeeklyCycleResult, RecurrenceDaysResult) - PASS
4. Function implementations (analyze_weekly_cycle, analyze_recurrence_days) - PASS
5. __all__ exports (12 items) - PASS
6. AC5/AC6 acceptance criteria in report - PASS

## Final Decision
**COMPLETE** - Task TASK-H01 fully implemented and validated.
