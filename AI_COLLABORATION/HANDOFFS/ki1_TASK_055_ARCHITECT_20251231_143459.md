summary:
  - Task: High-Win Forensik for events >450 EUR (not >=400 as current script)
  - Existing script analyze_high_win_forensik.py uses threshold=400; needs parameter change to >450
  - >450 EUR events include Typ6 6-hits(500), Typ7 7-hits(1000), Typ8 8-hits(10k), Typ9 8/9-hits, Typ10 9/10-hits
  - Current result has only 14 events from 2018-2024 backtest with threshold=400
  - Need separate analysis script or parameterized run with threshold=451
  - Output artifact: results/high_win_forensik_gt450.json
  - Repro: python scripts/analyze_high_win_forensik.py --threshold 451 --output results/high_win_forensik_gt450.json

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-event (individual high-win occurrences)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): high-win = payout > 450 EUR per event
- Rule 4 (target metric): forensik descriptive (weekday, birthday-ratio, clustering)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/analyze_high_win_forensik.py --threshold 451 -> results/high_win_forensik_gt450.json (requires threshold param addition)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-event (each payout event > 450 EUR)
- Semantics: Events from Typ6 (6-hit=500), Typ7 (7-hit=1000), Typ8 (8-hit=10000), Typ9 (8-hit=1000, 9-hit=50000), Typ10 (9-hit=1000, 10-hit=100000)
- Target metric: Descriptive forensik (weekday distribution, birthday-ratio, clustering p-value)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_high_win_forensik.py --threshold 451 --output results/high_win_forensik_gt450.json` (after threshold param added)
