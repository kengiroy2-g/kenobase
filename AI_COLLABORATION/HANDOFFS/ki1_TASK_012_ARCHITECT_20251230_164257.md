status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_012
role: ARCHITECT
phase: ARCHITECT
files_changed: []
summary:
  - HYP_002 Cooldown High-Wins tests whether high-value wins (>=100 EUR) are suppressed during post-jackpot cooldown
  - Extends existing WL-003 analysis (ROI focus) with High-Wins frequency focus
  - Existing artifact: results/post_jackpot_backtest.json (11 jackpots, 314 draws)
  - Current data shows 0/11 positive ROI periods post-jackpot (vs 2/11 normal for Typ 7)
  - High-Wins threshold: >=100 EUR (consistent with super_model_comparison_summary.md)
  - Implementation: Extend backtest_post_jackpot.py with high-wins counter
  - Acceptance: Count wins >=100 EUR in cooldown vs normal, chi-square test

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-period (30 days post-jackpot vs normal)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): High-Wins = wins >= 100 EUR; Cooldown = 30 days post-GK10_10
- Rule 4 (target metric): High-Wins frequency ratio (cooldown/normal)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/backtest_post_jackpot.py` -> `results/post_jackpot_backtest.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-period (30-day windows)
- Semantics: High-Wins >= 100 EUR; Cooldown = 30 days after GK10_10 jackpot
- Target metric: High-Wins frequency ratio (cooldown vs normal)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/backtest_post_jackpot.py` -> `results/post_jackpot_backtest.json`
