reviewed_handoff: "ki2_TASK-H03_EXECUTOR_20251227_222348.md"
summary:
  - cluster_reset.py implements all required functionality (detect, analyze, signals, report)
  - 26/26 unit tests passing - comprehensive coverage of edge cases
  - __init__.py correctly updated with all exports (lines 128-136, 251-258)
  - CLI script analyze_hyp003.py is complete with argparse, logging, NumpyEncoder
  - Syntax validation passed for all files
  - Baseline probability correctly uses KENO formula: 1 - 20/70 = 0.714
  - Lift calculation and is_significant logic correct (lift > 1.1 AND clusters >= 10)
  - No Known Bugs reproduced - implementation is standalone module

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): cluster >= 5 consecutive appearances; reset = non-appearance after cluster
- Rule 4 (target metric): Reset-Wahrscheinlichkeit (P(reset | cluster))
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_cluster_reset.py -v` -> 26/26 passed

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw
- Semantics: Cluster = >= 5 consecutive appearances of a number; Reset = number does not appear in next draw after cluster
- Target metric: Reset-Wahrscheinlichkeit (P(reset | cluster)) compared to Baseline (71.4%)

## Repro Commands
- `python -m py_compile kenobase/analysis/cluster_reset.py` -> Syntax OK
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_cluster_reset.py -v` -> 26/26 passed in 0.80s

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

**APPROVED** - Implementation is complete, well-tested, and follows established patterns. 

Key validations:
1. **MECHANISCH**: All 4 files created/updated correctly
2. **ARCHITEKTUR**: Follows recurrence.py pattern, correct baseline formula
3. **INTEGRATION**: All exports registered in __init__.py
4. **KNOWN BUGS**: None reproduced
