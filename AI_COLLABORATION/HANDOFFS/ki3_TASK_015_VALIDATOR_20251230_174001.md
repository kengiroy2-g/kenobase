summary:
  - Python syntax verified: py_compile PASS
  - Mann-Whitney U test correctly implemented (one-sided, alternative='greater')
  - Aggregated ROI calculations verified manually - avg diff +1.84% matches
  - JSON output valid (6430 lines, 11 jackpots, 5 ticket types)
  - Conclusion TREND_V2_BETTER accurate: 3/5 types V2 better, 0/5 significant
  - Acceptance criteria NOT met as documented (needs p<0.05 AND V2>V1)
  - Sample sizes adequate: n=314 draws per strategy per type
  - Statistical test logic correct for hypothesis testing

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-ticket-type (Typ 6-10) x Strategie (V1 vs V2)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): V1=OPTIMAL_TICKETS, V2=BIRTHDAY_AVOIDANCE_TICKETS_V2, Cooldown=30d post-GK10_10
- Rule 4 (target metric): ROI-Differenz V2 vs V1 im Cooldown, p<0.05
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/backtest_birthday_cooldown.py` -> `results/hyp005_birthday_cooldown.json` VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-ticket-type (Typ 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
- Semantics: ROI = (won - invested) / invested; Mann-Whitney U for daily wins
- Target metric: Statistical significance p<0.05 for V2 > V1

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/backtest_birthday_cooldown.py` -> `results/hyp005_birthday_cooldown.json`

# Validation

## Results Summary

| Type | V1 ROI | V2 ROI | Diff | V2 Better | p-value |
|------|--------|--------|------|-----------|---------|
| typ_6 | -71.02% | -65.61% | +5.41% | Yes | 0.074 |
| typ_7 | -47.77% | -54.78% | -7.01% | No | 0.210 |
| typ_8 | -67.20% | -68.15% | -0.96% | No | 0.052 |
| typ_9 | -58.60% | -54.46% | +4.14% | Yes | 0.337 |
| typ_10 | -66.56% | -58.92% | +7.64% | Yes | 0.219 |

**Avg ROI diff: +1.84%** (manually verified)
**Conclusion: TREND_V2_BETTER** - V2 better in 3/5 types, 0/5 significant tests
**Acceptance met: false** (correctly documented)

## Final Status
**APPROVED** - Implementation correct, reproducible, conclusion accurate.
