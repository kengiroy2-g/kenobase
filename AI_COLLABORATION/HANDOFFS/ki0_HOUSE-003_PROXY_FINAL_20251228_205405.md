status: COMPLETE
task: HOUSE-003
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - All 14 unit tests pass - implementation mechanically correct
  - CV calculation (std/mean) mathematically verified
  - Rolling windows 7/14/30 days produce correct window counts (359/352/336)
  - Hypothesis result NOT SUPPORTED is scientifically valid (CV 45-54% vs 15% threshold)
  - JSON output valid with all required fields in results/house003_rolling_stability.json
  - Exports correctly added to analysis/__init__.py
  - No architecture decisions required from user
  - Task deliverables complete and ready for integration

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (daily rolling windows over Keno draws)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): CV = std(window)/mean(window) for restbetrag values
- Rule 4 (target metric): stability (CV < 0.15 threshold)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/analyze_house003.py -> results/house003_rolling_stability.json (VERIFIED)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (daily rolling windows)
- Semantics: CV = std(window) / mean(window) for restbetrag field
- Target metric: stability (CV < 15% threshold indicates active payout control)

## Repro Commands
- python scripts/analyze_house003.py -> results/house003_rolling_stability.json (VERIFIED)
- python -m pytest tests/unit/test_house_edge_stability.py -v -> 14/14 passed (VERIFIED)

# Proxy Final Review

## Final Verdict
**COMPLETE** - Task HOUSE-003 is finished.

Validator thoroughly covered all critical aspects. Implementation is correct, well-tested (14/14 tests), and follows project standards. The hypothesis result (NOT SUPPORTED) is scientifically valid - no evidence of house-edge manipulation in Keno payouts.

No user escalation required - no open architecture decisions.
