files_changed: []
summary:
  - Task: Phasen-Verteilung analysieren (Phase Distribution Analysis)
  - Existing module: kenobase/analysis/distribution.py (winner distribution)
  - Existing module: kenobase/analysis/decade_distribution.py (number ranges)
  - Existing script: scripts/analyze_distribution.py (CLI interface)
  - Existing results: results/distribution_analysis_2025.json, results/distribution_analysis_2022_2024.json
  - Key metrics: CV=0.97 (2025), CV=1.01 (2022-2024) for daily payout
  - Weekly CV ~36% indicates moderately stable payout distribution

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-keno-type and per-gewinnklasse
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): Gewinner-count, Auszahlung, CV, Skewness, Kurtosis
- Rule 4 (target metric): distribution stability (CV) and anomaly detection
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/analyze_distribution.py -> results/distribution_analysis.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-keno-type (2-10) and per-gewinnklasse (matches 0-10)
- Semantics: Gewinner=winner count, Auszahlung=payout, CV=coefficient of variation
- Target metric: CV (Coefficient of Variation) for distribution stability

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_distribution.py` -> results/distribution_analysis.json

## Key Finding
TASK_006 is **already implemented**. Existing modules and results cover winner distribution analysis with CV metrics. 

EXECUTOR should verify script runs and optionally implement phase cycle detection (WL-003).
