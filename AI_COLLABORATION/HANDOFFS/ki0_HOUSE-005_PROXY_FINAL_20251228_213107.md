status: COMPLETE
task: HOUSE-005
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - All validator checks PASSED (syntax, imports, JSON structure, calculation)
  - Weighted average verified: (0.0*0.2 + 0.0*0.25 + 0.0*0.25 + 0.5*0.3) / 1.0 = 0.15
  - Verdict thresholds correct: STRONG>=0.7, MODERATE>=0.5, WEAK>=0.3, NO<0.3
  - Module exports: run_synthesis, SynthesisReport, HypothesisResult, DEFAULT_WEIGHTS
  - HOUSE-004 only supported hypothesis (3/9 Keno-Typen significant) -> evidence_score=0.5
  - Final verdict: NO_EVIDENCE (0.15 < 0.3) - data consistent with fair random draws
  - No architecture decisions required from User - all follows existing patterns
  - Handoff: AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki0_HOUSE-005_PROXY_FINAL_20251228_213107.md

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED (git status verified, SYSTEM_STATUS.json not present)
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): evidence_score (0.0-1.0), manipulation_verdict (4 levels), weighted aggregation
- Rule 4 (target metric): manipulation_evidence_score
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_house005.py` -> `results/house005_synthesis_report.json` VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (aggregates 4 hypothesis results into single synthesis)
- Semantics: evidence_score = weighted sum of hypothesis support (0.0-1.0)
- Target metric: overall_evidence_score (0.15 = NO_EVIDENCE verdict)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_house005.py` -> `results/house005_synthesis_report.json` VERIFIED

# Proxy Final Review

## Final Decision
**APPROVED** - Task HOUSE-005 is COMPLETE.

All validator checks passed. The implementation:
1. Follows Kenobase patterns (dataclasses, typing, logging)
2. Has transparent weighted methodology (20%/25%/25%/30%)
3. Produces reproducible results
4. Returns conservative NO_EVIDENCE verdict (appropriate given only 1/4 hypotheses supported)
5. No User escalation needed - no open architecture questions
