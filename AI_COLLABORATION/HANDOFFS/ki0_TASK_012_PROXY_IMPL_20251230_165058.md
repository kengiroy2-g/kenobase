task: TASK_012
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_IMPL
reviewed_handoff: "ki2_TASK_012_EXECUTOR_20251230_164658.md"
summary:
  - Script extended with HYP_002 high-wins counting (>=100 EUR threshold)
  - Chi-square test implemented correctly with N<5 guard clause
  - Results: 0 high-wins cooldown vs 1 normal = NOT_SIGNIFICANT
  - JSON artifact valid with proper hyp002 section structure
  - HYPOTHESES_CATALOG updated with HYP_002 section at lines 111-151
  - Python syntax verified OK via py_compile
  - No integration issues - standalone backtest script
  - Repro command verified: `python scripts/backtest_post_jackpot.py`

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-period (30-day windows post-jackpot vs normal)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): High-Wins >= 100 EUR; Cooldown = 30 days post-GK10_10
- Rule 4 (target metric): High-Wins frequency ratio (cooldown vs normal)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/backtest_post_jackpot.py` -> `results/post_jackpot_backtest.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-period (30-day windows)
- Semantics: High-Wins = wins >= 100 EUR per keno_quotes.py
- Target metric: High-Wins frequency ratio (cooldown vs normal)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/backtest_post_jackpot.py` -> `results/post_jackpot_backtest.json`

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

## Verification Summary

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Python syntax | OK | py_compile passed |
| JSON artifact valid | OK | hyp002 section present, conclusion=NOT_SIGNIFICANT |
| HYPOTHESES_CATALOG | OK | HYP_002 section added (lines 61-66, 111-151) |
| Chi-square guard | OK | N<5 correctly handled (lines 405-408) |
| Repro command | OK | Works, artifact generated |

## Key Findings

1. **Implementation correct**: HIGH_WIN_THRESHOLD=100 EUR aligns with keno_quotes.py payouts
2. **Statistical approach sound**: Chi-square with N<5 guard is appropriate
3. **Result valid**: NOT_SIGNIFICANT due to only 1 high-win in total sample (0 cooldown, 1 normal)
4. **Sample size limitation**: Known risk from PROXY_PLAN - would need >10k draws for significance
