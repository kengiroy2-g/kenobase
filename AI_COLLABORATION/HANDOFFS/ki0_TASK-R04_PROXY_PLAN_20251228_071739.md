status: ESCALATE
task: TASK-R04
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_TASK-R04_ARCHITECT_20251228_064338.md"
summary:
  - ARCHITECT correctly identified BLOCKER: EuroJackpot CSV lacks host_country field
  - CSV header verified: `Datum;S1;S2;z1;z2;z3;z4;z5` - no country data
  - regional_affinity.py pattern requires metadata field (`draw.metadata.get("region")`)
  - EXECUTOR cannot proceed without data source decision from user
  - Architectural approach (country_rotation.py module) is sound
  - Acceptance criteria are measurable and appropriate
  - ESCALATE required: data source decision is outside AI authority

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-country
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): EuroJackpot host country rotation
- Rule 4 (target metric): bet-selection
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): UNVERIFIED (blocked by data availability)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-country
- Semantics: EuroJackpot host country rotation
- Target metric: bet-selection

## Repro Commands
- `head -3 data/raw/eurojackpot/eurojackpot_archiv_bereinigt.csv` -> Confirms no host_country field

# Proxy Review

**ESCALATE to User** - Data source decision required:

| Option | Description | Effort |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **A** | Scrape host_country from external source | HIGH |
| **B** | Create static mapping file with known rotation schedule | LOW |
| **C** | Defer TASK-R04 until data resolved | NONE |
| **D** | Pivot to draw-day pattern analysis instead | MEDIUM |

**Recommendation:** Option B - static mapping file is simplest and allows EXECUTOR to proceed.
