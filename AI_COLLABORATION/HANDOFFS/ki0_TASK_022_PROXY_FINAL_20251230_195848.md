status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_022
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - Accepted validator replay of HYP_012 overlap: `results/overlap_statistics.json` (n=1457 draws from `data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv`) shows mean overlap 5.745 vs expected 5.714 and birthday ratio 0.44; no Bonferroni-significant deviations across PRE/POST/COOLDOWN/NORMAL.
  - Repro remains stable via `python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py > AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/v4_runtime/TASK_022_validator_overlap.log` -> `results/overlap_statistics.json`; no additional tests run.
  - CURRENT_STATUS unchanged, consistent with proxy impl and validator notes.
  - Final handoff recorded at `AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki0_TASK_022_PROXY_FINAL_20251230_195848.md` (status COMPLETE).

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (phase segments PRE_JACKPOT/POST_JACKPOT/COOLDOWN/NORMAL)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): overlap_count = intersection size vs previous draw; birthday_ratio = share of overlap numbers in 1-31
- Rule 4 (target metric): calibration
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py > AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/v4_runtime/TASK_022_validator_overlap.log -> results/overlap_statistics.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global with phase splits (PRE_JACKPOT/POST_JACKPOT/COOLDOWN/NORMAL)
- Semantics: overlap_count between consecutive draws; birthday_ratio share of overlap numbers in 1-31
- Target metric: calibration (observed vs expected overlap/birthday ratios)

## Repro Commands
- python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py > AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/v4_runtime/TASK_022_validator_overlap.log -> results/overlap_statistics.json

# Proxy Final Review
Validator covered the critical overlap/birthday tests and matched proxy stats; no open architecture decisions or deviations surfaced. User acceptance risk is low; deliverable finalized as COMPLETE with no changes to CURRENT_STATUS.
