role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - HYP_CYC_006 correctly documented as NICHT SIGNIFIKANT in HYPOTHESES_CATALOG.md
  - Table entry at line 68 with correct counts (V2=3, ORIG=2) and Chi² n/a note
  - Detail section at lines 552-598 with complete phase breakdown
  - Changelog entry at line 603 with proper date stamp
  - Sample sizes verified: N=1457 (PRE_JACKPOT=116, POST_JACKPOT=87, COOLDOWN=121, NORMAL=1133)
  - Statistical non-applicability properly justified (expected cells < 5)
  - Documentation-only task completed correctly - no code changes needed
  - All acceptance criteria met - ready for next task

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-phase (PRE_JACKPOT, POST_JACKPOT, COOLDOWN, NORMAL)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): v2_highwins (>=100 EUR), v2_rate_per_100, orig_highwins
- Rule 4 (target metric): High-Win frequency clustering by cycle phase
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py` -> `results/cycles_comprehensive_analysis.json` VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-phase (4 cycle phases)
- Semantics: High-Win = Gewinn >= 100 EUR per draw
- Target metric: High-Win Rate per 100 draws, clustering by phase

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py` -> `results/cycles_comprehensive_analysis.json` VERIFIED

# Proxy Final Review

## Final Decision
**APPROVED** - Task completed correctly. HYP_CYC_006 (High-Win-Clustering) is correctly classified as NICHT SIGNIFIKANT due to insufficient sample size (only 3 V2 and 2 ORIG High-Win events in 1457 draws). Documentation is complete with table entry, detail section, and changelog.
