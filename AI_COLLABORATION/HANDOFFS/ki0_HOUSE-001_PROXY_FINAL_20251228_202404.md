status: COMPLETE
task: HOUSE-001
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - HYP-015 module complete with jackpot_correlation.py (557 lines)
  - 32/32 unit tests pass (2 expected ConstantInputWarning)
  - Analysis: N=737 draws (18 jackpot, 719 normal)
  - HYP-015 FALSIFIED: Pearson r=0.017, p=0.65
  - Chi-Square p=0.74 confirms no association
  - All 22 exports verified working
  - Pattern consistent with odds_correlation.py
  - Ready for integration

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): GK1Event, birthday_ratio (1-31), high_ratio (32-70)
- Rule 4 (target metric): correlation (Pearson r, Spearman r, Chi-Quadrat)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_hyp015_jackpot.py` -> `results/hyp015_jackpot_correlation.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw
- Semantics: GK1Event dataclass, birthday/high number ratios
- Target metric: Pearson/Spearman correlation, Chi-Square

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_hyp015_jackpot.py` -> `results/hyp015_jackpot_correlation.json`
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_jackpot_correlation.py -v` -> 32 passed

# Proxy Final Review

## Final Assessment

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Validator covered all critical aspects | YES |
| User would accept this change | YES |
| Architecture questions for user | NONE |

## Verdict: **COMPLETE**

HYP-015 analysis module is fully implemented, tested, and documented. The hypothesis that jackpot draws correlate with birthday-number ratios is **FALSIFIED** (r=0.017, p=0.65). No escalation needed.
