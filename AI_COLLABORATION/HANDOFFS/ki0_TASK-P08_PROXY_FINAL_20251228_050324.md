status: COMPLETE
task: TASK-P08
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - GameConfig.get_expected_sum_mean() correctly implemented at config.py:60-69
  - Formula E[sum] = n * (min+max)/2 verified for KENO=710.0, EJ=127.5, Lotto=150.0
  - _run_sum_analysis() uses dynamic expected_mean from game config (runner.py:404-411)
  - _get_config_snapshot() includes expected_sum_mean in output (runner.py:458-488)
  - Validator confirmed integration test: 526 EJ draws with expected_sum_mean=127.5
  - No BUG-001 (global vs specific) - all values computed per-game dynamically
  - Syntax checks PASSED, no regressions detected
  - APPROVED for production - EuroJackpot model transfer complete

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-game
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): numbers_range, numbers_to_draw, expected_sum_mean
- Rule 4 (target metric): validation (game-specific expected_mean flows correctly)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -c "from kenobase.core.config import GameConfig; print(GameConfig(name='EJ',numbers_range=(1,50),numbers_to_draw=5).get_expected_sum_mean())"` -> 127.5

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-game
- Semantics: GameConfig.get_expected_sum_mean() = n * (min+max)/2
- Target metric: Correct expected_sum_mean per game in pipeline output

## Repro Commands
- `python -c "from kenobase.core.config import GameConfig; print(GameConfig(name='EJ',numbers_range=(1,50),numbers_to_draw=5).get_expected_sum_mean())"` -> 127.5

# Proxy Final Review

## Validator Coverage Assessment
All critical aspects verified:
1. Formula mathematically correct
2. Integration flows from config to runner to output
3. Per-game dynamic calculation (no global hardcoding)
4. No regressions

## Final Decision
**APPROVED** - Task TASK-P08 is COMPLETE
