status: COMPLETE
task: STRAT-004
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - Validator verified all critical aspects: syntax, imports, logic, statistical tests
  - Implementation correct: train/test split (880/577), no data leakage
  - Holiday filter (3-day window around GERMAN_HOLIDAYS) works correctly
  - Mann-Whitney U one-sided test correctly applied (p=0.58)
  - Scientific finding: NO_IMPROVEMENT is valid negative result
  - Regime detection: All HMM states mapped to NORMAL (data limitation)
  - Acceptance criteria NOT passed (expected for non-working strategy)
  - Task COMPLETE: Implementation is sound; hypothesis not supported by data

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): regime_state + weekday + holiday_proximity -> PLAY/AVOID
- Rule 4 (target metric): hit_rate (popular 1-31) + Mann-Whitney p<0.05
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/backtest_cycle_surfing.py --data data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv --train-split 2024-06-01` -> `results/cycle_surfing_backtest.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw
- Semantics: regime_state (HMM) + weekday + holiday -> PLAY/AVOID
- Target metric: hit_rate improvement + statistical significance

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/backtest_cycle_surfing.py --data data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv --train-split 2024-06-01` -> `results/cycle_surfing_backtest.json`

## Decision: COMPLETE

The Cycle Surfing strategy (STRAT-004) was correctly implemented and tested. The **NO_IMPROVEMENT** result (p=0.58) is a valid scientific negative finding - the hypothesis that combining HMM regime detection with temporal cycles improves hit rates is not supported by the data.

Key observations:
1. All HMM states mapped to NORMAL (insufficient economic metadata to differentiate regimes)
2. Holiday filter avoided 41 draws but didn't improve hit rate
3. Weekday filter derived from train data showed no significant bias
4. Strategy hit rate (0.44375) essentially equals baseline (0.44385)

This is a scientifically correct negative result, not a bug.
