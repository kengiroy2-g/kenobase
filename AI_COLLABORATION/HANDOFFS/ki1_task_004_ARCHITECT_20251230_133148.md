summary:
  - Task: Integrate EconomicState into ML prediction pipeline (O1.5/O2.5 State-Awareness)
  - Existing: economic_state.py (4 states: NORMAL/COOLDOWN/RECOVERY/HOT) + regime_detection.py (HMM-based)
  - Gap: ML models (KenoPredictor, EnsemblePredictor) do not use state information
  - Plan: Add StateAwarePredictor wrapper combining state detection + ensemble prediction
  - New features: state-conditional thresholds, state-based alpha weighting, state-tagged predictions
  - Acceptance: State-aware F1 >= baseline F1, state distribution matches economic_state labels
  - Test scope: Unit tests for StateAwarePredictor, integration with existing EnsemblePredictor
---

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw (each prediction tagged with state)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): EconomicState.state_label Ôêê {NORMAL, COOLDOWN, RECOVERY, HOT}
- Rule 4 (target metric): bet-selection (action recommendation based on state)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (StateAwarePredictor wraps existing modules)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): UNVERIFIED (no existing script; will define in checklist)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw (state computed per draw, predictions tagged accordingly)
- Semantics: EconomicState dataclass fields (date, spieleinsatz, jackpot, rolling_cv, state_label)
- Target metric: bet-selection ROI improvement via state-conditional action recommendations

## Repro Commands
- To be created: `python scripts/test_state_aware_predictor.py` -> `results/state_aware_validation.json`
