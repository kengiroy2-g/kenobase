phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki5_VALID-001_ARCHITECT_20251230_055852.md"
summary:
  - ARCHITECT correctly identified existing Train->Test infrastructure in scripts/backtest_cross_game_rule_layer_train_test.py
  - Script implements proper frozen rules pattern: _mine_rules_train() called ONLY on train slices (lines 478-499)
  - Rules are stored in rules_train, then passed to backtest WITHOUT re-mining (lines 526-539)
  - Current result shows 0 rules mined at alpha=0.05 (train period 2022-2023 has no significant couplings)
  - Validation gap is real: no unit test asserts the frozen-rules invariant
  - Plan is actionable: add test that verifies rules passed to backtest are NOT re-fitted
  - EuroJackpot correctly included as source but NOT treated as ecosystem member (consistent with CLAUDE.md)
  - Repro command verified: output file exists with expected structure

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): ConditionalLift q_value <= alpha; frozen = mined on Train only
- Rule 4 (target metric): Out-of-Sample rule accuracy lift
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/backtest_cross_game_rule_layer_train_test.py` -> `results/cross_game_rule_layer_train_test_backtest.json` VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global
- Semantics: CrossGameRule frozen on Train
- Target metric: Out-of-Sample accuracy lift

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/backtest_cross_game_rule_layer_train_test.py --train-end 2023-12-31` -> `results/cross_game_rule_layer_train_test_backtest.json` VERIFIED

# Proxy Review

**APPROVED** - Plan is sound. The frozen rules implementation is correct in the existing script. The validation gap (missing unit test for frozen rules invariant) is correctly identified. Adding a test will formalize this as a regression guard.
