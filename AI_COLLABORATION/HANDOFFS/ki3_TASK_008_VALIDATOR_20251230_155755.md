summary:
  - Tests: 11/11 passed in tests/unit/test_frequency_per_year.py (1.68s)
  - Exports: calculate_frequency_per_year, YearlyFrequencyResult correctly exported
  - Script: scripts/analyze_frequency_per_year.py runs successfully
  - Results: results/frequency_per_year.json contains years 2022-2025, total_draws=1457
  - Code quality: Frozen dataclass, proper type hints, Google-style docstrings
  - Granularity: per-year (phase = year), consistent with Axiom A5
  - No issues found, implementation complete

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-year
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): YearlyFrequencyResult(year, number, absolute_frequency, relative_frequency, total_draws)
- Rule 4 (target metric): frequency-analysis (Axiom A5)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_frequency_per_year.py --verbose` -> `results/frequency_per_year.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-year
- Semantics: YearlyFrequencyResult dataclass
- Target metric: frequency stability analysis per Axiom A5

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_frequency_per_year.py -v` -> 11/11 passed
- `python scripts/analyze_frequency_per_year.py --verbose` -> `results/frequency_per_year.json`
