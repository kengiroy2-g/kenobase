# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): sum/mean/centroid/presence_vector/normalized_vector
- Rule 4 (target metric): time-series cross-game coupling analysis
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_number_representations.py -v` -> 16 passed (1.73s)

## Task Setup
