task: TASK_052
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_TASK_052_ARCHITECT_20251231_134056.md"
summary:
  - CRITICAL: high_win_forensik.json contains 0 Typ-9 events (only Typ-6: 11, Typ-7: 3)
  - Plan assumes filtering from existing forensik data - will yield empty result
  - KENO Typ-9 high wins (8/9=1000 EUR, 9/9=50000 EUR) are extremely rare
  - 2018-2024 backtest shows Typ-9 tickets were tested but had 0 high payout events
  - Script pattern (analyze_typ7_highwin.py) is correct but input data is missing
  - Need either: (a) synthetic simulation, (b) extended date range, or (c) task scope change
  - Recommend: ARCHITECT must verify data availability before planning filtering scripts
  - Return to ARCHITECT with data verification requirement

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-keno-type (Typ-9 spezifisch)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): birthday_ratio, weekday_distribution, preceding_draw_pattern
- Rule 4 (target metric): descriptive forensik
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): UNVERIFIED - no Typ-9 events in source data

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-keno-type (Typ-9)
- Semantics: birthday_ratio, weekday_dist, preceding_draw
- Target metric: descriptive forensik (pattern documentation)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_typ9_highwin.py` -> will produce empty result (0 events)
- Verified: `results/high_win_forensik.json` has 14 events, 0 are Typ-9

# Proxy Review

**REJECTION REASON:** Data Availability Not Verified

The ARCHITECT plan is structurally sound (follows analyze_typ7_highwin.py pattern), but assumes Typ-9 high-win events exist in `results/high_win_forensik.json`. Verification shows **ZERO Typ-9 events** in this file:
- Typ-6: 11 events
- Typ-7: 3 events  
- Typ-9: 0 events

This is statistically expected: Typ-9 8/9 probability ≈ 1/7,500 draws. With 2,237 draws in the dataset, expected events ≈ 0.3.

**Options for ARCHITECT:**
1. Expand data scope (include 2025, other sources)
2. Create synthetic/theoretical analysis
3. Document as NULL RESULT (valuable scientific finding)
