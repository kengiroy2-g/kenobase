summary:
  - Created recurrence.py module (380 lines) with WGZ analysis functions
  - Implemented analyze_recurrence() for consecutive draw comparisons
  - Implemented analyze_pair_stability() for duo frequency tracking
  - Implemented calculate_gk1_correlation() linking recurrence to GK1 events
  - Implemented analyze_number_streaks() for consecutive appearance detection
  - Created analyze_hyp006.py CLI script with full workflow
  - Added 26 unit tests in test_recurrence.py (all passing)
  - Verified with 2237 KENO draws: 100% recurrence rate, 5.73 avg recurring numbers

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): WGZ = recurring numbers between consecutive draws
- Rule 4 (target metric): pattern-predictability
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_hyp006.py --data-dir data/raw/keno --keno-file KENO_ab_2018.csv --output results/hyp006/wgz_analysis.json` -> `results/hyp006/wgz_analysis.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw
- Semantics: WGZ = Wiederkehrende Gewinnzahlen
- Target metric: pattern-predictability

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_hyp006.py --data-dir data/raw/keno --keno-file KENO_ab_2018.csv --output results/hyp006/wgz_analysis.json`
- Output: `results/hyp006/wgz_analysis.json`

# Umsetzung

Implementation complete with all 4 acceptance criteria passing:
- AC1: Recurrence rate calculated (100%)
- AC2: Pair stability measured (2415 stable pairs)
- AC3: GK1 correlation computed (4 events analyzed)
- AC4: Streaks identified (multiple numbers with 3+ consecutive appearances)
