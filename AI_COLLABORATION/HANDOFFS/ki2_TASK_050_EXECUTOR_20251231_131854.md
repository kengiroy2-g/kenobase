  - scripts/analyze_typ7_highwin.py
  - results/typ7_highwin_forensik.json
summary:
  - Created scripts/analyze_typ7_highwin.py for dedicated Typ-7 (1.000 EUR) forensik
  - Script filters Typ-7 events from existing high_win_forensik.json
  - N=3 Typ-7 events confirmed (2018-06-18, 2020-07-21, 2023-04-16)
  - Birthday ratio mean: 0.45 (near expected 0.443)
  - Weekday distribution: Sonntag/Dienstag/Montag (1 each, no clear pattern)
  - Comparison with Typ-6 (N=11) as baseline included
  - CAVEAT: N=3 limits statistical power (noted in output)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-keno-type (Typ-7)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): high_win_event = Typ-7 with 7/7 hits = 1.000 EUR payout
- Rule 4 (target metric): event frequency, birthday_ratio, weekday_distribution
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_typ7_highwin.py` -> `results/typ7_highwin_forensik.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-keno-type (Typ-7)
- Semantics: Typ-7 = 7 numbers selected, 7/7 hits = 1.000 EUR payout
- Target metric: descriptive forensik (frequency, patterns, birthday-ratio)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_typ7_highwin.py` -> `results/typ7_highwin_forensik.json`

# Umsetzung

## Deliverables

### 1. Script: scripts/analyze_typ7_highwin.py
- Dedicated Typ-7 forensik analysis
- Reads from existing high_win_forensik.json
- Filters only keno_type=7 events
- Computes: weekday distribution, birthday ratio, strategy distribution
- Includes Typ-6 comparison as baseline

### 2. Output: results/typ7_highwin_forensik.json
- typ7_events_total: 3
- typ7_unique_dates: 3
- birthday_ratio_mean: 0.45
- preceding_draw_birthday_ratio_mean: 0.35

## Key Findings

| Metric | Typ-7 (N=3) | Typ-6 (N=11) | Delta |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Birthday Ratio Mean | 0.450 | 0.445 | +0.005 |
| Preceding Draw BR Mean | 0.350 | 0.418 | -0.068 |

## Caveats
- **N=3 is too small for statistical significance**
- Results are descriptive only
