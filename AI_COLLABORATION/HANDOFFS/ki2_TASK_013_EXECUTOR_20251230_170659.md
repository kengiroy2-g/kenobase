status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_013
role: EXECUTOR
phase: EXECUTOR
files_changed:
  - scripts/analyze_weekday_roi.py (NEW)
  - results/weekday_roi_analysis.json (NEW)
summary:
  - Created scripts/analyze_weekday_roi.py with weekday ROI stratification for V2-Ticket Type 9
  - Reused temporal_cycles.analyze_dimension() for Chi-square test (verified at lines 96-212)
  - Implemented weekday-shuffle nullmodell (shuffles weekday assignments, 1000 permutations)
  - Output saved to results/weekday_roi_analysis.json (1457 draws, 2022-2025)
  - Result: ROI-Spread 490.1% (best=Di +423.1%, worst=Mo -67.0%) passes >= 20% criterion
  - Chi-square p=1.0 (draws perfectly uniform across weekdays, KENO daily)
  - Nullmodell p=0.374 -> Spread NOT SIGNIFICANT (single jackpot hit on Tuesday)
  - VERDICT: CONFIRMED (ROI criterion) but NOT_SIGNIFICANT (nullmodell says due to chance)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (per-weekday, 7 categories)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): weekday=0-6 (Mo-So), ROI per V2-Ticket Type 9
- Rule 4 (target metric): ROI stratification + Chi-square p-value
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_weekday_roi.py` -> `results/weekday_roi_analysis.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (per-weekday stratification, 7 categories)
- Semantics: weekday=0-6 (Monday-Sunday), ROI computed per V2-Ticket Type 9
- Target metric: ROI per weekday + Chi-square for draw frequency + nullmodell p-value

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_weekday_roi.py` -> `results/weekday_roi_analysis.json`
