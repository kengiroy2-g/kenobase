**Key Finding:** HYP-004 is **NOT SUPPORTED** by the data. The correlation between popular numbers (derived from Gewinnquoten winner counts) and draw frequency is actually slightly **positive** (r=0.0497), not negative as the hypothesis predicted. This means there is no evidence that the RNG avoids popular numbers.
