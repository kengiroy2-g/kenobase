status: APPROVED
task: TASK_043
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_IMPL
reviewed_handoff: "ki2_TASK_043_EXECUTOR_20251231_032541.md"
summary:
  - Implementation validates A3 axiom "Ein Gewinn treibt alles" correctly
  - Script uses DataLoader.load() API with DrawResult objects (architecture-consistent)
  - Structured tickets from SYSTEM_STATUS.json correctly integrated
  - Random baseline (100 seeds) confirms structural limitation of Typ-2
  - Result: Typ-6/8/10 = 100% months with wins (PASS), Typ-2 = 91.7% (FAIL)
  - JSON output valid, N=1457 draws, 48 months coverage confirmed
  - Semantics match axiom definition: win = >=2 matches (lowest GK tier)
  - No Known Bugs introduced (BUG-001 to BUG-010 checked)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-ticket-type (Typ-2, Typ-6, Typ-8, Typ-10)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): winning_month = month with >=2 matches at least once
- Rule 4 (target metric): win_frequency_per_month (threshold: >95%)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/validate_win_frequency.py -v` -> results/win_frequency_validation.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-ticket-type (Typ-2, Typ-6, Typ-8, Typ-10)
- Semantics: A month counts as "winning" if ticket achieves >=2 matches at least once
- Target metric: win_frequency = months_with_win / total_months (acceptance: >95%)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/validate_win_frequency.py -v` -> results/win_frequency_validation.json

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

## Mechanisch (PASS)
- Script syntax valid (py_compile)
- JSON output parseable
- All files created as claimed

## Architektur (PASS)
- Uses kenobase.core.data_loader.DataLoader (correct API)
- DrawResult objects correctly consumed
- CLI uses click (consistent with project scripts)

## Integration (PASS)
- Standalone validation script, no orchestrator coupling needed
- Data path consistent with project convention

## Known Bugs Check (PASS)
- No Known Bugs (BUG-001 to BUG-010) reproduced

## Conclusion
**APPROVED** - Implementation correct, architecture-consistent, ready for Validator phase.
