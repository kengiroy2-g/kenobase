summary:
  - Scraper infrastructure verified: 5 modules in kenobase/scraper/
  - CLI script scripts/scrape_press.py exists with argparse interface
  - LANDESLOTTERIEN configs + PressReleaseScraper + KenoWinnerParser all exported via __init__.py
  - ARCHITECT correctly identified: NO new implementation needed
  - Task is validation + test execution, not development
  - Repro commands provided are executable
  - No Known Bugs triggered (no global thresholds, no orchestrator needed)
  - EXECUTOR should validate imports and run test scrape

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-bundesland
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): KenoWinnerRecord(bundesland, city, region, numbers, keno_type, amount_eur, draw_date)
- Rule 4 (target metric): data-collection (N extracted records)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/scrape_press.py --sites bayern --verbose` -> data/scraped/*.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-bundesland (16 Landeslotterien)
- Semantics: KenoWinnerRecord dataclass
- Target metric: Successful data extraction

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/scrape_press.py --list` -> shows 16 Lotterien
- `python scripts/scrape_press.py --sites bayern --verbose` -> JSON output

# Proxy Review

**APPROVED** - ARCHITECT's plan is sound. Scraper infrastructure exists and is complete.

EXECUTOR instructions:
1. Verify dependencies in requirements.txt
2. Run import test
3. Execute test scrape against one Lotterie
4. Validate JSON output
