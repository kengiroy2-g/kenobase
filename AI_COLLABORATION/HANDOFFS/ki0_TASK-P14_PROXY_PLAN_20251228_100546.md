status: APPROVED
task: TASK-P14
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_TASK-P14_ARCHITECT_20251228_100246.md"
summary:
  - Plan is mechanically complete with clear deliverables
  - SHAP TreeExplainer is optimal for LightGBM (O(n) vs O(2^n) for KernelExplainer)
  - Integration point verified: KenoPredictor.get_feature_importance() at model.py:467-480
  - shap>=0.44.0 dependency to be added to requirements.txt (line 47)
  - Config extension in config/default.yaml under ml: section (line 202+)
  - Correlation >= 0.7 with native importance is reasonable acceptance criterion
  - No global thresholds issue (per-number granularity maintained)
  - New module location kenobase/prediction/explainability.py follows existing pattern

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-number
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): SHAP values = feature contribution to prediction
- Rule 4 (target metric): interpretability (correlation >= 0.7 with native)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_explainability.py -v`
