## ESCALATION TO USER

**PROBLEM:** EuroJackpot data lacks country/host field. Additionally, EuroJackpot draws are conducted centrally in Helsinki, Finland - there may be no "country rotation" to analyze.

**OPTIONS:**
- **A:** Create external mapping file (manual research)
- **B:** Extend data loader for web scraping
- **C:** Deprioritize/cancel task

**EMPFEHLUNG:** Option C - Deprioritize unless you have evidence that EuroJackpot actually rotates hosting between countries.

**Questions for User:**
1. Does EuroJackpot actually rotate hosting between countries?
2. If yes, where can this data be obtained?
3. If no, should the task be cancelled or repurposed?
