phase: ARCHITECT
files_changed: []
summary:
  - HOUSE-003 tests Rolling House-Edge Stability via CV over 7/14/30 day windows
  - Reuses StakeDrawRecord from stake_correlation.py (restbetrag, auszahlung fields)
  - New module: kenobase/analysis/house_edge_stability.py
  - New script: scripts/analyze_house003.py
  - Acceptance: CV < 15% on at least 2 of 3 windows indicates active payout control
  - Data source: Keno_GPTs/Keno_Ziehung2023_+_Restbetrag_v2.CSV (769 records)
  - Output: results/house003_rolling_stability.json

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): CV = std/mean of restbetrag over rolling windows
- Rule 4 (target metric): stability (CV < 15%)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_house003.py` -> results/house003_rolling_stability.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (daily rolling windows)
- Semantics: CV = Coefficient of Variation over 7/14/30 day windows
- Target metric: CV < 0.15 indicates active payout control

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_house003.py` -> results/house003_rolling_stability.json

# Implementierungsplan

**New files to create:**
1. `kenobase/analysis/house_edge_stability.py` - Core logic
2. `scripts/analyze_house003.py` - CLI script  
3. `tests/unit/test_house_edge_stability.py` - Unit tests

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AC1: CV correctly calculated (std/mean)
- AC2: Rolling windows correctly formed
- AC3: Threshold classification works (CV < 0.15 = STABLE)
- AC4: JSON output is valid
- AC5: Script runs without errors
- AC6: At least 3 unit tests pass

**WORKING_SET_REQUEST for EXECUTOR:**
- kenobase/analysis/stake_correlation.py
- kenobase/analysis/__init__.py
- scripts/analyze_house002.py
- config/default.yaml
