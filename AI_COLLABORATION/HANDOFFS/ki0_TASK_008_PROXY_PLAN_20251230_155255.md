status: APPROVED
task: TASK_008
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_TASK_008_ARCHITECT_20251230_155054.md"
summary:
  - ARCHITECT claims verified: TASK_008 already fully implemented
  - Module exists: kenobase/analysis/frequency.py:379-483 (YearlyFrequencyResult + calculate_frequency_per_year)
  - Script exists: scripts/analyze_frequency_per_year.py
  - Results exist: results/frequency_per_year.json (1457 draws, years 2022-2025) - verified via JSON read
  - Tests exist: tests/unit/test_frequency_per_year.py
  - No code changes needed - task completed by prior work
  - Granularity (per-year) matches task requirement (per-phase)
  - Repro command verified: outputs consistent with claims

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-year (phase = year)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): YearlyFrequencyResult(year, number, absolute_frequency, relative_frequency, total_draws)
- Rule 4 (target metric): frequency stability (Axiom A5 validation)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (no new code needed)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_frequency_per_year.py` -> `results/frequency_per_year.json` - CONFIRMED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-year
- Semantics: YearlyFrequencyResult dataclass with year, number, absolute_frequency, relative_frequency, total_draws
- Target metric: Year-over-Year stability analysis for Axiom A5 validation

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_frequency_per_year.py` -> `results/frequency_per_year.json`
- `pytest tests/unit/test_frequency_per_year.py -v` -> all 12 tests pass

# Proxy Review

**APPROVED** - TASK_008 is already complete. All claims verified:
- Code at frequency.py:379-483 confirmed
- All 4 artifacts exist (module, script, results, tests)
- JSON data shows 1457 draws across years 2022-2025
