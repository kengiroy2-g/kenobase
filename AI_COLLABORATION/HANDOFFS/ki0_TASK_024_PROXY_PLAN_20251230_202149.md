reviewed_handoff: "ki1_TASK_024_ARCHITECT_20251230_201849.md"
summary:
  - HYP_014 tests temporal autocorrelation in overlap_count time series (lag=1..7)
  - Existing data: results/overlap_statistics.json (N=1457, mean=5.74)
  - Plan correctly identifies missing autocorrelation analysis
  - Block-permutation null model preserves weekly structure - appropriate choice
  - Acceptance criterion |r|<0.1 if random is reasonable
  - Script reference test_hyp013 exists and shows overlap calculation pattern
  - WORKING_SET item kenobase/physics/metrics.py does NOT exist - Executor must use scipy.stats directly
  - Plan is complete, testable, and follows Axiom-First methodology

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (overlap_count time series)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): overlap_count = |numbers_t ∩ numbers_{t-1}|, range 0-20
- Rule 4 (target metric): autocorrelation r at lag=1..7
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (standalone script, no module changes)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/test_hyp014_overlap_autocorrelation.py` -> `results/hyp014_overlap_autocorrelation.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (entire time series)
- Semantics: overlap_count = number of shared numbers between consecutive draws
- Target metric: Pearson autocorrelation coefficient at multiple lags

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/test_hyp014_overlap_autocorrelation.py` -> `results/hyp014_overlap_autocorrelation.json`

# Proxy Review

**APPROVED** - Plan is methodologically sound. Minor note: `kenobase/physics/metrics.py` does not exist; Executor should use scipy.stats/pandas directly for autocorrelation calculation.
