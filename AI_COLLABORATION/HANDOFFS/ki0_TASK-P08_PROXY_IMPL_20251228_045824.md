status: APPROVED
task: TASK-P08
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_IMPL
reviewed_handoff: "ki2_TASK-P08_EXECUTOR_20251228_045524.md"
summary:
  - GameConfig.get_expected_sum_mean() verified at config.py:60-69
  - _run_sum_analysis() correctly computes expected_mean dynamically (runner.py:404-411)
  - _get_config_snapshot() includes game info and dynamic expected_mean (runner.py:458-488)
  - KENO=710.0, EuroJackpot=127.5, Lotto=150.0 - all mathematically correct
  - Integration test passed: 526 EuroJackpot draws, config_snapshot shows expected_sum_mean=127.5
  - Syntax check passed for both config.py and runner.py
  - No BUG-001 (global vs specific) - dynamic computation is per-game
  - No integration gaps detected - config change flows correctly to runner

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-game
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): numbers_range, numbers_to_draw, expected_sum_mean
- Rule 4 (target metric): validation (pipeline runs end-to-end with correct game-specific expected_mean)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze.py -g eurojackpot analyze -d data/raw/eurojackpot/eurojackpot_archiv_bereinigt.csv` -> stdout JSON with expected_sum_mean=127.5

## Repro Commands
- `python -c "from kenobase.core.config import GameConfig; g = GameConfig(name='EJ', numbers_range=(1,50), numbers_to_draw=5); print(g.get_expected_sum_mean())"` -> 127.5
- `python scripts/analyze.py -g eurojackpot analyze -d data/raw/eurojackpot/eurojackpot_archiv_bereinigt.csv` -> JSON with config_snapshot.game.expected_sum_mean=127.5

## Verdict
**APPROVED** - Implementation is correct, minimal, and follows architecture. Ready for Validator.
