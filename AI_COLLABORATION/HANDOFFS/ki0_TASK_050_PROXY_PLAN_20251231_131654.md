reviewed_handoff: "ki1_TASK_050_ARCHITECT_20251231_045846.md"
summary:
  - Plan creates dedicated Typ-7 forensik script (1.000 EUR payout analysis)
  - Only 3 Typ-7 events found in 2018-2024 (N=3 limits statistical power)
  - Template exists: scripts/analyze_high_win_forensik.py
  - Output path defined: results/typ7_highwin_forensik.json
  - Birthday-ratio and weekday analysis scoped correctly
  - No Red Flags: no global thresholds, no missing integration points
  - Repro command provided and verifiable
  - Appropriate P2 priority for exploratory forensik task

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-keno-type (Typ-7 specific)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): high_win_event = Typ-7 with 7/7 hits = 1.000 EUR payout
- Rule 4 (target metric): event frequency, birthday_ratio, weekday_distribution
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_typ7_highwin.py` -> `results/typ7_highwin_forensik.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-keno-type (Typ-7)
- Semantics: Typ-7 = 7 numbers selected, 7/7 hits = 1.000 EUR payout
- Target metric: descriptive forensik (frequency, patterns, birthday-ratio)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_typ7_highwin.py` -> `results/typ7_highwin_forensik.json`

# Proxy Review

**APPROVED** - Handoff created at `AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki0_TASK_050_PROXY_PLAN_20251231_131654.md`

Key verification:
- Existing forensik data confirms 3 Typ-7 events (N=3)
- Template script exists for implementation
- No architectural conflicts or integration issues
- Low N acknowledged as exploratory limitation
