status: APPROVED
task: DIST-005
role: VALIDATOR
phase: VALIDATOR
validated_handoff: "ki0_DIST-005_PROXY_IMPL_20251228_225811.md"
summary:
  - Syntax verified: Both distribution_synthesis.py and analyze_dist005.py pass py_compile
  - CLI execution OK: python scripts/analyze_dist005.py runs successfully, outputs 3/4 sources
  - Weighted average CORRECT: (0.2559*0.30 + 0.96*0.25 + 0.7346*0.25) / 0.80 = 0.6255
  - Verdict thresholds verified: STABLE (>=0.70), SUSPICIOUS (0.40-0.69), RANDOM (<0.40)
  - Edge cases pass: empty list, all unavailable, single source all return correct values
  - JSON schema valid: All required keys present in output
  - Graceful degradation confirmed: DIST-004 NO_DATA correctly excluded from weighting
  - Pattern match: Implementation follows house_edge_synthesis.py architecture

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (cross-hypothesis synthesis)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): evidence_score (0.0-1.0), verdict (STABLE/SUSPICIOUS/RANDOM)
- Rule 4 (target metric): overall distribution stability indicator
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/analyze_dist005.py -> results/dist005_synthesis.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (aggregates DIST-001/002/003/004 results)
- Semantics: evidence_score (0.0-1.0), verdict enum (STABLE/SUSPICIOUS/RANDOM)
- Target metric: Overall distribution stability indicator

## Repro Commands
- python scripts/analyze_dist005.py -> results/dist005_synthesis.json

# Validation

All tests passed:
- Syntax: OK
- Execution: OK (3/4 sources, score=0.6255, verdict=SUSPICIOUS)
- Weighted average: Mathematically verified correct
- Verdict thresholds: All 7 test cases pass
- Edge cases: Empty list, all unavailable, single source - all correct
- JSON schema: All required keys present
- Graceful degradation: DIST-004 NO_DATA handled correctly
