validated_handoff: "ki0_TASK_026_PROXY_IMPL_20251230_205451.md"
summary:
  - Script syntax valid (py_compile passed)
  - JSON output valid with complete structure (7 top-level keys)
  - 36 OOS year-pairs verified (4 train * 3 test * 3 keno_types)
  - BH/FDR implementation correct (tested with known values)
  - In-sample vs OOS labels correct (train==test -> in_sample)
  - All in-sample delta_roi > 0 (+16.85 to +298.90pp) confirms overfitting
  - Reproducibility confirmed (rerun matches original output)
  - Key finding: 0/36 FDR-significant, mean OOS delta=-9.51pp (rules hurt)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-year-pair
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): train_year, test_year, delta_roi, fdr_significant, rules_roi, baseline_roi
- Rule 4 (target metric): generalization (ROI transfer stability across year-pairs)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/walk_forward_yearly_transfer.py --output results/yearly_transfer_matrix.json` -> results/yearly_transfer_matrix.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-year-pair (train_year x test_year x keno_type)
- Semantics: delta_roi = rules_roi - baseline_roi, fdr_significant via BH correction at alpha=0.10
- Target metric: OOS ROI generalization

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/walk_forward_yearly_transfer.py --output results/yearly_transfer_matrix.json`
