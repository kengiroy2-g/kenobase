# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-number (1-70 for KENO)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): combined_score (0-1), tier (A/B/C), 20 feature columns
- Rule 4 (target metric): bet-selection
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_features.py -v` -> 29 passed in 1.25s

## Task Setup

- Semantics: combined_score 0-1 normalized, tier A/B/C classification, 20 features per number
- Target metric: bet-selection

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_features.py -v` -> 29 passed in 1.25s
- `python -c "from kenobase.features import FeatureRegistry; print(FeatureRegistry().count())"` -> 20
