# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): high_stake = top 25%; unpopular = below-median popularity
- Rule 4 (target metric): Spearman r correlation
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_house002.py` -> `results/house002_stake_popularity.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw
- Semantics: high_stake = top 25% (75th percentile); unpopular = below-median heuristic popularity
- Target metric: Spearman |r| > 0.15 with p < 0.05

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_house002.py` -> `results/house002_stake_popularity.json`
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_stake_correlation.py::TestAnalyzeHighStakePopularityBias -v`

# Umsetzung

Implementation complete. Analysis result: HOUSE-002 hypothesis NOT SUPPORTED (r=0.024, p=0.64).
