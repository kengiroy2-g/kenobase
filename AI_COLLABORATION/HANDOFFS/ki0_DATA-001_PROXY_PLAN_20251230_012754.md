summary:
  - Two conflicting handoffs exist for DATA-001 (011453 vs 011854)
  - 011453: alignment_quality.py for existing _align_source_to_target()
  - 011854: New TimelineGrid class in kenobase/core/timeline.py
  - Both approaches valid but architecturally different
  - Current code already has bisect_right alignment in cross_lottery_coupling.py:136-154
  - No timeline.py exists yet (Glob confirmed)
  - Plan files define DATA-001 as "Multi-Game Timeline (daily grid)"
  - ESCALATE: User must choose between enhancement vs new module

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-game (KENO daily, Lotto Wed+Sat, EJ Tue+Fri)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): date alignment, draw-day masks, forward-fill strategy
- Rule 4 (target metric): alignment coverage / cross-game correlation enablement
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): UNVERIFIED (new module vs helper unclear)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): UNVERIFIED (no repro commands in handoffs)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-game (different draw schedules)
- Semantics: daily grid with NaN for non-draw days, forward-fill option
- Target metric: enable cross-game analysis with proper temporal alignment

## Repro Commands
- UNVERIFIED (handoffs lack concrete repro commands)

# Proxy Review

**ESCALATED** - Two conflicting ARCHITECT approaches require user decision:

| Option | Approach | Effort | Risk |
|--------|----------|--------|------|
| A | Enhance existing `_align_source_to_target()` with quality metrics | 3.5h | Low |
| B | New `TimelineGrid` core module (daily grid) | ~6h | Medium |

**Recommendation:** Option B aligns with plan definition ("Multi-Game Timeline (daily grid) bauen") and serves as foundation for METHOD-001..004.
