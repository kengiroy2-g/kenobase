role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_IMPL
reviewed_handoff: "ki2_TASK_039b_EXECUTOR_20251231_012835.md"
summary:
  - Script scripts/compare_v1_v2_weekday.py created with correct V1/V2 ticket definitions (verified against backtest_birthday_cooldown.py:37-52)
  - JSON output validated (results/v1_v2_weekday_comparison.json) with correct structure
  - Nullmodell implemented correctly (weekday-preserving shuffle, 1000 permutations)
  - Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction applied across 5 types (0/5 significant)
  - Result: V2 trend +8.53% avg, 3/5 types better, but NOT statistically significant
  - Syntax check passed (py_compile)
  - No Known Bugs triggered (BUG-001..010)
  - No cross-file integration issues detected

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-weekday (7 categories: Mo-So)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): V1=Original, V2=Birthday-Avoidance, ROI=(winnings-invested)/invested*100
- Rule 4 (target metric): ROI-difference V2-V1 per weekday, BH-corrected significance
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/compare_v1_v2_weekday.py` -> `results/v1_v2_weekday_comparison.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-weekday (7 Kategorien: Mo, Di, Mi, Do, Fr, Sa, So)
- Semantics: V1=Original OPTIMAL_TICKETS, V2=Birthday-Avoidance, ROI per weekday computed
- Target metric: ROI-Differenz V2-V1, multiple-testing corrected significance

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/compare_v1_v2_weekday.py` -> `results/v1_v2_weekday_comparison.json`

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

## Verification Summary

| Dimension | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| MECHANISCH | PASS | Syntax OK, JSON valid, AC met |
| ARCHITEKTUR | PASS | Uses correct keno_quotes, V1/V2 match verified |
| INTEGRATION | PASS | Standalone script, no side effects |
| KNOWN BUGS | PASS | None triggered |

## Key Findings

1. **V1/V2 Ticket Match**: Lines 37-52 in both files are identical
2. **Nullmodell**: Weekday shuffle preserves draw content but randomizes weekday assignment - correct approach
3. **BH Correction**: Applied to 5 p-values (one per type), not 35 (7x5) - conservative but valid
4. **Result**: +8.53% V2 advantage is within variance (0/5 significant tests)
