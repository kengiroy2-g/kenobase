  - Results JSON valid with correct structure and interpretation
  - Hypothesis REJECTED: Pearson r=0.08, p=0.49 (not significant)
  - German number format handling correct (1.443 -> 1443)
  - Classification: 8 safe, 13 popular, 49 neutral numbers
  - Code quality meets standards (types, docstrings, dataclasses)
  - No breaking changes, isolated module with clean exports
  - Ready for production use

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw + per-number aggregation
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): winner_count per Keno-Typ/date, avg_winners per number
- Rule 4 (target metric): Pearson/Spearman correlation with p-value
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): pytest tests/unit/test_odds_correlation.py -v -> 15/15 passed (0.80s)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw (join) + per-number (aggregation)
- Semantics: winner_count = Anzahl der Gewinner, weighted by Keno-Typ/10
- Target metric: Pearson/Spearman correlation coefficient with significance testing

## Repro Commands
- pytest tests/unit/test_odds_correlation.py -v -> 15/15 passed (0.80s)
- python scripts/analyze_hyp010.py -> results/hyp010_odds_correlation.json

# Proxy Final Review

## Validator Coverage Assessment

| Aspect | Validator Checked | Sufficient |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| Unit Tests | YES - 15/15 pass | YES |
| Module Exports | YES - 10 symbols | YES |
| Edge Cases | YES - empty, insufficient | YES |
| Result Structure | YES - JSON validated | YES |
| Statistical Method | YES - Pearson/Spearman | YES |
| German Number Format | YES - 1.443 = 1443 | YES |

## User Acceptance Check

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Does implementation match HYP-010 description? | YES |
| Are results scientifically sound? | YES |
| Is output actionable? | YES |
| Any breaking changes? | NO |
| Any hidden complexity? | NO |

## Hypothesis Result

**HYP-010: Gewinnquoten mit gezogenen Zahlen korrelieren**

Result: **NOT SIGNIFICANT** (Hypothesis Rejected)

- Pearson r = 0.0842, p = 0.4883
- Spearman r = 0.0653, p = 0.5913
- The RNG does not favor or avoid popular numbers

## Final Decision

**COMPLETE** - Task fully implemented, tested, and validated.
