status: COMPLETE
task: COUPLE-001
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - Final proxy sign-off for directed coupling TE/CMI (kNN, block permutations) and CLI outputs; no new concerns beyond known missing KI profile/system_status.json twin.
  - Handoff recorded at `AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki0_COUPLE-001_PROXY_FINAL_20251230_043050.md`.
  - CURRENT_STATUS updated with PROXY_FINAL entry noting reused validator coverage and absent artifacts.
  - No additional tests executed in this phase; relying on validator/executor runs (see repro commands).

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED (SYSTEM_STATUS.md read; ADR_AXIOM_FIRST_FRAMEWORK.md read; git status run; KI profile `ki0_proxy.md` missing in repo)
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): directed pair/lag TE/CMI with kNN estimator, permutation p/q, BH q by method/control, segment/control flags, representation/history metadata
- Rule 4 (target metric): accuracy
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python -m pytest tests/unit/test_alternative_coupling.py -q -> console (25 passed per validator); python scripts/analyze_alternative_methods.py --method te --lags 1 --n-permutations 5 --k-neighbors 3 --k-history-target 1 --use-synthetic --output results/alternative_coupling_synthetic.json -> results/alternative_coupling_synthetic.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global
- Semantics: TE/CMI per directed pair/lag conditioned on target/source histories with block-permutation nulls; BH grouped by method/control; metadata includes segment/control, representations, histories, permutations
- Target metric: accuracy

## Repro Commands
- python -m pytest tests/unit/test_alternative_coupling.py -q -> console (25 passed; reused from validator)
- python scripts/analyze_alternative_methods.py --method te --lags 1 --n-permutations 5 --k-neighbors 3 --k-history-target 1 --use-synthetic --output results/alternative_coupling_synthetic.json -> results/alternative_coupling_synthetic.json

# Proxy Final Review
- Validator coverage sufficient; TE/CMI pipeline, metadata propagation, and CLI outputs align with plan. Missing artifacts (`SYSTEM_STATUS.json`, KI profile `ki0_proxy.md`) remain noted but not blocking approval.
