role: EXECUTOR
phase: EXECUTOR
files_changed: []
summary:
  - Block-Permutation implementation verified at kenobase/analysis/null_models.py L152-210
  - NullModelType.BLOCK_PERMUTATION enum confirmed at kenobase/core/axioms.py L23
  - NullModelRunner integration at L407-408 supports block_size parameter
  - All 27 unit tests in tests/unit/test_null_models.py PASS (including 4 TestBlockPermutation)
  - Axiom P1.3 uses BLOCK_PERMUTATION for House-Edge variance test (L119)
  - Implementation handles remainder blocks, is reproducible with seed, and safe for empty data
  - Task was already DONE - no code changes required, only verification
  - CONFIRMED: No additional work needed

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (null model framework)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): block_permutation shuffles entire blocks, preserves within-block structure
- Rule 4 (target metric): statistical validity of permutation tests
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_null_models.py -v` -> 27 passed in 1.76s
