status: COMPLETE
task: HYP-004
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - Implementation complete: popularity_correlation.py (484 lines, well-structured)
  - All 21 unit tests pass (pytest verified by Validator)
  - Scientific result: HYP-004 NOT SUPPORTED (r=0.0497, p=0.683)
  - Acceptance criteria NOT met: need r < -0.2 AND p < 0.05
  - GQ data properly used (2237 draws analyzed)
  - Walk-forward validation: only 2.0% (45/2208) windows show support
  - Module exports correctly integrated in __init__.py (12 symbols)
  - analyze_hyp004.py script functional and produces valid JSON output

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (all 70 KENO numbers)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): popularity=GQ winner counts, frequency=draw appearances
- Rule 4 (target metric): Spearman r < -0.2 with p < 0.05
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_hyp004.py` -> data/results/hyp004_correlation.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (all 70 KENO numbers)
- Semantics: popularity from GQ winners, frequency from draws
- Target metric: Spearman r < -0.2 AND p < 0.05

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_popularity_correlation.py -v` -> 21 passed
- `python scripts/analyze_hyp004.py` -> data/results/hyp004_correlation.json (289KB)

# Proxy Final Review

## Validator Coverage Assessment
Validator (ki3) verified all critical aspects:
- Unit tests: 21/21 pass
- Syntax: py_compile OK
- JSON output: valid structure (289KB)
- Module imports: 12 new symbols exported
- Script execution: successful
- Acceptance criteria: evaluated correctly

## User Acceptance Evaluation
**YES** - Implementation meets project standards:
1. Scientific rigor with Spearman correlation
2. Clear falsification result (p=0.683 >> 0.05)
3. Fully reproducible via script
4. Walk-forward validation (2208 windows)
5. Clean module integration

## Scientific Finding
**HYP-004 FALSIFIED**:
- Correlation: r = 0.0497 (need < -0.2)
- P-value: 0.683 (need < 0.05)
- Support ratio: 2.0% (45/2208 windows)

No evidence that RNG avoids popular numbers.

## Final Decision
**STATUS: COMPLETE** - Task ready for closure.
