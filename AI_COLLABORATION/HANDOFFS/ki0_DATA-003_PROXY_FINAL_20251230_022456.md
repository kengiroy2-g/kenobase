status: COMPLETE
task: DATA-003
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - All 33 unit tests pass (16 number_representations + 17 alternative_coupling)
  - Syntax and imports verified OK by Validator
  - Methods implemented: TE, MI, DTW, Granger (4 coupling methods)
  - Number representations: sum, mean, centroid, presence_vector, normalized_vector
  - Axiom-First paradigm correctly followed (coupling tests, not pattern-mining)
  - EuroJackpot as negative control implemented
  - Train/Test split at 2024-01-01 implemented
  - Optional dependencies documented in requirements.txt lines 51-54

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-lottery
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): TIME_SERIES (sum, mean, centroid, presence_vector, normalized_vector)
- Rule 4 (target metric): Coupling strength (TE bits, Granger F-stat, MI bits, DTW distance)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_number_representations.py tests/unit/test_alternative_coupling.py -v` -> 33 passed

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-lottery
- Semantics: Time-series representations for cross-lottery coupling analysis
- Target metric: Statistical coupling measures with FDR-corrected p-values

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_number_representations.py tests/unit/test_alternative_coupling.py -v` -> 33 passed in ~2s

# Proxy Final Review

**Validator Assessment:** All 9 acceptance criteria passed. Implementation is complete.

**Architecture Consistency:** 
- Correctly reuses `bh_fdr` from existing module (no duplication)
- Uses `GAME_RANGES` from normalizer for pool size normalization
- Follows established dataclass patterns

**User Perspective:**
- Would user accept? **YES** - Clean implementation with full test coverage
- Breaking changes? **NO** - All new modules
- Pending decisions? **NO** - All design choices follow established patterns

**Final Decision: APPROVED**
