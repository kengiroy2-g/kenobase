reviewed_handoff: "ki1_METHOD-002_ARCHITECT_20251230_024056.md"
summary:
  - DTW implementation verified at alternative_coupling.py:455-576 - O(n²) basic implementation exists
  - Tests verified at test_alternative_coupling.py:140-175 (TestDTWDistance class, 3 tests)
  - Plan to add Sakoe-Chiba band constraint (O(n*w) improvement) is sound and non-breaking
  - API extension via optional params preserves backward compatibility
  - Acceptance criteria (p<0.05 on known-coupled series) is measurable and appropriate
  - Granularity per-lottery-pair matches ecosystem analysis scope
  - No Known Bugs triggered (no global thresholds, no integration issues)
  - Repro command verified: pytest tests/unit/test_alternative_coupling.py::TestDTWDistance -v

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-lottery-pair
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): DTW distance (normalized, negative for similarity)
- Rule 4 (target metric): coupling detection (p-value from permutation test)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_alternative_coupling.py::TestDTWDistance -v` -> tests pass

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-lottery-pair
- Semantics: DTW distance between time-series representations of lottery draws
- Target metric: Coupling significance (q-value <= 0.05 after BH-FDR)

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_alternative_coupling.py::TestDTWDistance -v` -> existing 3 tests

# Proxy Review

**APPROVED** - Plan verified against actual codebase. Implementation at `alternative_coupling.py:455-576` confirmed. Tests at `test_alternative_coupling.py:140-175` confirmed. Sakoe-Chiba band constraint extension is backward-compatible and architecturally sound.
