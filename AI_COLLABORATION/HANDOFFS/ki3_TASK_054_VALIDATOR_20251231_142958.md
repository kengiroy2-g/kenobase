validated_handoff: "ki0_TASK_054_PROXY_IMPL_20251231_142758.md"
summary:
  - Syntax verification passed (py_compile OK)
  - JSON structure validated (8 keys, all 5 types present)
  - Event counts verified against sources: Typ-6(11) + Typ-7(3) + Typ-8(2) = 16 total
  - Birthday ratios within expected range: Typ-6=0.445, Typ-7=0.450, Typ-8=0.424 (expected ~0.443)
  - Null hypothesis correctly applied for Typ-9/10 (absence_consistent_with_expectation)
  - All 6 acceptance criteria passed
  - Script reproducibility confirmed
  - Code quality acceptable (manual review clean)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-keno-type (Typ-6 through Typ-10)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): events_count, birthday_ratio_mean, weekday_distribution, strategy_distribution, null_hypothesis, payout_per_hit_eur
- Rule 4 (target metric): descriptive comparison (no ROI optimization)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (standalone script, no module changes)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_cross_type_highwin.py` -> `results/cross_type_highwin_comparison.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-keno-type (Typ-6 through Typ-10)
- Semantics: events_count, unique_dates, payout_per_hit_eur, birthday_ratio_mean, weekday_distribution, strategy_distribution, null_hypothesis, caveat
- Target metric: descriptive comparison (no ROI optimization)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_cross_type_highwin.py` -> `results/cross_type_highwin_comparison.json`

# Validation

## Test Results

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Syntax (py_compile) | PASS |
| Script execution | PASS |
| JSON structure | PASS (8 keys) |
| Event count match | PASS (16 total) |
| Birthday ratio range | PASS (all within 0.05 of expected) |
| Null hypothesis Typ-9 | PASS |
| Null hypothesis Typ-10 | PASS |

## Acceptance Criteria

All 6 acceptance criteria passed:
- AC1: Covers Typ-6 to Typ-10
- AC2: Aggregates existing forensik
- AC3: Birthday ratio comparison (3 types)
- AC4: Null hypothesis for rare types
- AC5: Output to correct path
- AC6: Standalone script
