# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw + per-number aggregation
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): winner_count per Keno-Typ/date, avg_winners per number
- Rule 4 (target metric): Pearson/Spearman correlation with p-value
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_hyp010.py` -> `results/hyp010_odds_correlation.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw (join) + per-number (aggregation)
- Semantics: winner_count = Anzahl der Gewinner, weighted by Keno-Typ/10
- Target metric: Pearson/Spearman correlation

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_hyp010.py` -> `results/hyp010_odds_correlation.json`
- `pytest tests/unit/test_odds_correlation.py -v` -> 15/15 passed
