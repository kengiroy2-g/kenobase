status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_046
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - APPROVED: Validator correctly verified all acceptance criteria
  - VERIFIED: Changelog entry at HYPOTHESES_CATALOG.md:646-652 documents reconciliation
  - CONFIRMED: Frequency strategy avg_roi = +30.9% is absolute ROI (12 iterations)
  - CONFIRMED: Position rules delta_roi = 0.0 measures improvement over baseline (35 comparisons)
  - CONFIRMED: Semantic distinction prevents false contradiction between two analyses
  - CONFIRMED: FDR correction shows 0/35 significant for position rules (alpha=0.1)
  - NO ESCALATION: Documentation-only change with no architectural decisions needed
  - NO BREAKING CHANGES: All scripts compile, no code modifications made

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-strategy (frequency, position-rules)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): avg_roi (absolute), delta_roi (improvement)
- Rule 4 (target metric): documentation reconciliation
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_ticket_lifecycle.py` + `python scripts/walk_forward_lookback_grid.py` VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-strategy + per-keno-type
- Semantics: avg_roi (absolute ROI percentage), delta_roi (rules improvement over baseline)
- Target metric: Documentation reconciliation

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_ticket_lifecycle.py` -> `results/ticket_lifecycle_analysis.json`
- `python scripts/walk_forward_lookback_grid.py` -> `results/walk_forward_lookback_grid.json`

# Proxy Final Review

## Validator Verification
All 6 validation points confirmed by ki3:
1. Changelog entry at lines 646-652 documents reconciliation
2. Mean ROI +30.93% matches documented +30.9%
3. Outlier iteration 11 (+1037.78%) flagged as 8-hit high-win
4. ALL 35 delta_roi = 0.0 for position rules
5. FDR fdr_significant_count=0 confirmed
6. Both scripts compile

## User Acceptance: YES
- Clear documentation of semantic difference (avg_roi vs delta_roi)
- Reproducible commands documented
- No hidden gotchas

## Escalation: NO
- Documentation-only change
- No architectural decisions needed
- Aligns with existing ADRs

## Final Decision
**COMPLETE** - Task TASK_046 approved.
