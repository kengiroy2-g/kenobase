**Key Points:**
- Task: Compare V1 (Original/Pair-based) vs V2 (Birthday-Avoidance) tickets on high-win forensik

- Need new script `scripts/compare_v1_v2_high_win_forensik.py` for parallel comparison
- Output: `results/v1_v2_high_win_forensik_comparison.json`
- Frozen tickets from `OPTIMAL_TICKETS_KI1` (V1) and `BIRTHDAY_AVOIDANCE_TICKETS_V2` (V2)
