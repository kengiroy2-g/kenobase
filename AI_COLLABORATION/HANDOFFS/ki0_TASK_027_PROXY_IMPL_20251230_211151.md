summary:
  - Script walk_forward_lookback_grid.py syntactically valid (py_compile OK)
  - Output JSON valid and correctly structured at results/walk_forward_lookback_grid.json
  - Lookback grid correctly implements [30, 60, 90, 180, 365, 540, 730] per plan
  - BH/FDR correction implemented at lines 510-549, correctly returns significance flags
  - Per-type granularity maintained (typ_6 through typ_10), no global thresholds (BUG-001 avoided)
  - delta_roi metric correctly computed as rules_roi - baseline_roi per keno_type
  - best_lookback_by_type output correctly structured with fdr_significant flag
  - Standalone script - no cross-file integration issues

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-keno_type (Typ 6-10)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): recent_draws = lookback window (days), delta_roi = rules_roi - baseline_roi
- Rule 4 (target metric): delta_roi (ROI improvement through position rules vs baseline frequency)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (standalone script, no integration dependencies)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/walk_forward_lookback_grid.py --output results/walk_forward_lookback_grid.json` -> results/walk_forward_lookback_grid.json CONFIRMED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-keno_type (Typ 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
- Semantics: recent_draws = lookback period in days, delta_roi = difference between rules-based ROI and baseline frequency ROI
- Target metric: delta_roi (ROI improvement)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/walk_forward_lookback_grid.py --output results/walk_forward_lookback_grid.json` -> results/walk_forward_lookback_grid.json

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

**Verdict: APPROVED**

Implementation is mechanically correct, architecturally consistent, and produces valid output. The null result (all delta_roi = 0) is expected given the strict FDR-corrected rule validation - only 1 frozen rule survived validation, and it has no effect on ticket selection. This is a scientifically valid outcome consistent with Axiom-First principles.
