status: APPROVED
task: TASK_024
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_IMPL
reviewed_handoff: "ki2_TASK_024_EXECUTOR_20251230_202349.md"
summary:
  - Implementation correctly tests HYP_014 overlap-autocorrelation at lag=1..7
  - Block-permutation null model with 7-day blocks preserves weekly structure (correct design)
  - Syntax check passed (py_compile), JSON output valid
  - N=1456 observations, mean=5.749 matches expected 5.714 (basic sanity OK)
  - Max |r|=0.0684 at lag=4 (below 0.1 threshold), but permutation tests significant at lag=4,7
  - Decision logic follows Axiom-First: permutation test significance triggers SUPPORT
  - No integration issues (standalone script, no module dependencies)
  - Reproducible: python scripts/test_hyp014_overlap_autocorrelation.py -> results/hyp014_overlap_autocorrelation.json

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (overlap_count time series)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): overlap_count = |numbers_t ∩ numbers_{t-1}|, range 0-20
- Rule 4 (target metric): Pearson autocorrelation r at lag=1..7
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (standalone script, no kenobase module changes)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/test_hyp014_overlap_autocorrelation.py` -> `results/hyp014_overlap_autocorrelation.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (entire overlap time series)
- Semantics: overlap_count = number of shared numbers between consecutive draws
- Target metric: Pearson autocorrelation coefficient at multiple lags

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/test_hyp014_overlap_autocorrelation.py` -> `results/hyp014_overlap_autocorrelation.json`

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

**Verdict: APPROVED** - Implementation is correct, follows Axiom-First methodology, produces valid reproducible output. No integration issues or known bugs. Ready for Validator.
