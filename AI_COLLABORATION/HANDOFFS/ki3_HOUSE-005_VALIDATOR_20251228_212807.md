status: APPROVED
task: HOUSE-005
role: VALIDATOR
phase: VALIDATOR
validated_handoff: "ki0_HOUSE-005_PROXY_IMPL_20251228_212607.md"
summary:
  - Syntax validation PASSED: house_edge_synthesis.py, analyze_house005.py
  - Module import verified: run_synthesis, SynthesisReport, HypothesisResult, DEFAULT_WEIGHTS
  - JSON output valid: 4 keys (hypothesis, description, synthesis, methodology)
  - Weighted average calculation verified: (0.0*0.2 + 0.0*0.25 + 0.0*0.25 + 0.5*0.3) / 1.0 = 0.15
  - Script reproducibility PASSED: runs successfully, output matches expected
  - Verdict thresholds verified: STRONG>=0.7, MODERATE>=0.5, WEAK>=0.3, NO<0.3
  - Dataclass architecture correct with proper type hints
  - HOUSE-004 is only supported hypothesis (3/9 Keno-Typen significant)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED (SYSTEM_STATUS.json not found but git status verified)
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): evidence_score (0.0-1.0), manipulation_verdict (4 levels)
- Rule 4 (target metric): manipulation_evidence_score
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_house005.py` -> `results/house005_synthesis_report.json` VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (aggregates 4 hypothesis results)
- Semantics: evidence_score = weighted sum of hypothesis support (0.0-1.0)
- Target metric: overall_evidence_score (0.15 = NO_EVIDENCE verdict)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_house005.py` -> `results/house005_synthesis_report.json` VERIFIED

# Validation
