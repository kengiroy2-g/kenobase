summary:
  - TASK-R03 "Regionale Zahlen-Affinitaet (Bundesland)" cannot be implemented
  - HYP-003 already marked WON'T FIX in KENOBASE_ISSUES.md:711-740
  - Available data (Keno_GQ_*.csv) contains only national aggregate winner counts
  - No Bundesland-level data in any repository files
  - Alternative data sources would require web-scraping regional Lotto sites (out of scope)
  - DATA_SOURCES.md:232-258 documents hypothesis but notes data limitations
  - Recommendation: Close task or redefine scope to use available aggregated data

**Handoff created:** `AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki1_TASK-R03_ARCHITECT_20251228_062027.md`

**Decision:** WON'T FIX - The task duplicates HYP-003 which was already closed because no Bundesland-level data exists in the repository. The available quota files only contain aggregated national winner counts.
