status: APPROVED

reviewed_handoff: "ki1_TASK_013_ARCHITECT_20251230_170158.md"
summary:
  - APPROVED: Architect correctly renamed to Weekday-ROI Analysis (avoids HYP-003 conflict)
  - VERIFIED: temporal_cycles.analyze_dimension() exists at lines 96-212, supports weekday Chi-square
  - DISCOVERED: scripts/analyze_cycles_deep.py already has weekday ROI stratification (lines 100-135)
  - REUSE RECOMMENDATION: Executor should extract/refactor weekday ROI logic from analyze_cycles_deep.py
  - Script name scripts/analyze_weekday_roi.py is correct (no collision with analyze_hyp003*.py)
  - Output results/weekday_roi_analysis.json is distinct from any HYP-003 artifacts
  - Acceptance criteria measurable: ROI_diff >= 20% OR p<0.05
  - Nullmodell (weekday-preserving shuffle) is correctly specified

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (per-weekday, 7 categories)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): weekday=0-6 (Monday-Sunday), ROI per weekday for V2-Tickets
- Rule 4 (target metric): ROI stratification (primary), Chi-square p-value (secondary)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_weekday_roi.py` -> `results/weekday_roi_analysis.json`

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_weekday_roi.py` -> `results/weekday_roi_analysis.json`
