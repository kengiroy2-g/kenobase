status: APPROVED

role: VALIDATOR
phase: VALIDATOR
validated_handoff: "ki0_TASK_022_PROXY_IMPL_20251230_195337.md"
summary:
  - Replayed overlap analysis; results/overlap_statistics.json (n=1457 draws from data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv) unchanged, no Bonferroni-significant deviations vs expected overlap 5.714 / birthday ratio 0.4429.
  - Command `python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py > AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/v4_runtime/TASK_022_validator_overlap.log` succeeded; outputs match proxy handoff stats.
  - Validator handoff stored at AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki3_TASK_022_VALIDATOR_20251230_195537.md.
  - CURRENT_STATUS not modified.

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global + per-phase (PRE_JACKPOT/POST_JACKPOT/COOLDOWN/NORMAL)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): overlap_count with previous draw; birthday_ratio within overlaps vs expected baselines
- Rule 4 (target metric): calibration
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py > AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/v4_runtime/TASK_022_validator_overlap.log -> results/overlap_statistics.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global + per-phase (PRE_JACKPOT/POST_JACKPOT/COOLDOWN/NORMAL)
- Semantics: overlap_count and overlap_birthday_ratio per draw vs expected overlap 5.714 and birthday_ratio 0.4429
- Target metric: calibration

## Repro Commands
- python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py > AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/v4_runtime/TASK_022_validator_overlap.log -> results/overlap_statistics.json

# Validation
- Ran the overlap analysis pipeline; regenerated results/overlap_statistics.json with the above command (log in AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/v4_runtime/TASK_022_validator_overlap.log). Outputs align with proxy handoff: mean overlap 5.745, z=0.688, p=0.492; per-phase overlaps 5.67–5.84 and birthday ratios 0.435–0.462 all non-significant under Bonferroni alpha 0.00333.
- No discrepancies or additional issues observed; acceptance maintained.
