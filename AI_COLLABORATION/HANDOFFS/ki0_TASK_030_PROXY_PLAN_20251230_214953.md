summary:
  - Block-Permutation implementation verified at kenobase/analysis/null_models.py L152-210
  - NullModelType.BLOCK_PERMUTATION enum confirmed at kenobase/core/axioms.py L23
  - Unit tests at tests/unit/test_null_models.py L86-136 - all 4 tests PASS
  - NullModelRunner integration confirmed at L407-408 (block_size parameter supported)
  - Implementation quality good: handles remainder, reproducible with seed, empty data safe
  - Task was ALREADY DONE - no further changes needed
  - APPROVED as status confirmation

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (null model framework)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): block_size=7 (weekly blocks), preserves within-block structure
- Rule 4 (target metric): p-value (permutation-based statistical significance)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_null_models.py::TestBlockPermutation -v` -> 4/4 PASSED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (framework-level null model implementation)
- Semantics: block_size parameter (default 7 for weekly blocks)
- Target metric: p-value for permutation tests

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_null_models.py::TestBlockPermutation -v` -> 4 PASSED (verified)

# Proxy Review

**APPROVED** - TASK_030 "Nullmodell: Block-Permutation" was already fully implemented. All 4 verification dimensions passed:
1. MECHANISCH: Implementation complete with tests
2. ARCHITEKTUR: ADR-conform (Axiom-First framework)
3. INTEGRATION: All relevant files covered
4. KONZEPTIONELL: Parameterized block_size, no global thresholds
