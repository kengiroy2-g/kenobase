  - __all__ exports at lines 350, 352 in kenobase/analysis/__init__.py
  - JSON artifact valid: results/frequency_per_year.json with metadata, yearly_frequencies, summary
  - Data covers 2022-2025 with 1457 total draws
  - CLI script functional (--help, --input, --output, --verbose)
  - No regressions or architecture violations
  - Task ready for commit

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-year
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): {year, number, absolute_frequency, relative_frequency, total_draws}
- Rule 4 (target metric): frequency distribution stability (Axiom A5)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_frequency_per_year.py -v` -> 11/11 passed; `python scripts/analyze_frequency_per_year.py` -> results/frequency_per_year.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-year
- Semantics: YearlyFrequencyResult dataclass with 5 fields (year, number, absolute, relative, total_draws)
- Target metric: year-over-year frequency consistency (Axiom A5 validation)

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_frequency_per_year.py -v` -> 11/11 passed
- `python scripts/analyze_frequency_per_year.py` -> results/frequency_per_year.json

# Proxy Final Review

## Validation Checks
1. **Validator Coverage**: Validator ki3 verified all critical aspects - unit tests, imports, exports, artifact validity, CLI functionality
2. **User Acceptance**: YES - Feature is complete, well-tested (11 tests), follows project patterns
3. **Architecture Questions**: None - additive changes, no breaking changes, follows existing kenobase/analysis/ patterns

## Decision: COMPLETE

No escalation needed. Task TASK_007 approved for completion.

**Handoff:** `AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki0_TASK_007_PROXY_FINAL_20251230_154854.md`
