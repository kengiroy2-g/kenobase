status: APPROVED
task: TASK_023
role: VALIDATOR
phase: VALIDATOR
validated_handoff: "ki0_TASK_023_PROXY_IMPL_20251230_201248.md"
summary:
  - Script compiles successfully (py_compile OK)
  - Reproducibility verified: re-run produces identical outputs (1457 draws, 17 jackpots, same phase counts)
  - Expected values mathematically correct: overlap=5.714 (20*20/70), birthday_ratio=0.443 (31/70)
  - Phase assignments correct: PRE(n=24), POST(n=38), COOLDOWN(n=274), NORMAL(n=1120); sum=1456
  - Statistical tests valid: KW p=0.93 (overlap), p=0.53 (birthday); all pairwise MW p_adj>=0.87
  - Multiple testing corrections (Bonferroni+BH) properly applied; no false positives
  - Decision logic correct: HYP_013 REJECTED (support=false)
  - REPRO_COMMANDS.md entry verified at line 184-187

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (phase-stratified)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): overlap_count, birthday_ratio, phase labels (PRE/POST/COOLDOWN/NORMAL)
- Rule 4 (target metric): calibration
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/test_hyp013_overlap_birthday_phase.py --draws data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv --jackpots data/processed/ecosystem/timeline_2025.csv --output results/hyp013_overlap_birthday_phase.json` -> results/hyp013_overlap_birthday_phase.json VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (phase-stratified by jackpot cycle)
- Semantics: overlap_count = |numbers_t ∩ numbers_{t-1}|; birthday_ratio = birthday numbers in overlap / overlap_count
- Target metric: calibration (testing deviations from expected values by phase)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/test_hyp013_overlap_birthday_phase.py --draws data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv --jackpots data/processed/ecosystem/timeline_2025.csv --output results/hyp013_overlap_birthday_phase.json` -> results/hyp013_overlap_birthday_phase.json VERIFIED

# Validation

**APPROVED** - All validation checks pass:
1. Script compiles without error
2. Reproducibility confirmed (identical output on re-run)
3. Mathematical expectations correct
4. Statistical tests with proper MTC corrections
5. Decision logic sound: HYP_013 correctly REJECTED
