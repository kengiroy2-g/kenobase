status: REJECTED
task: STATE-001
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki5_STATE-001_ARCHITECT_20251230_032608.md"
summary:
  - KI0 proxy profile missing in repo; SYSTEM_STATUS.json absent (read SYSTEM_STATUS.md instead) so guardrails/known integration points unverified.
  - Plan lacks orchestrator/pipeline wiring for the regime module (only new file/config mentioned), risking BUG-003 orphan feature.
  - Observables for change-points/HMM undefined (numbers vs economic proxies), leaving state_label semantics misaligned with `kenobase/core/economic_state.py`.
  - Acceptance criteria and reproducibility not operationalized (placeholder validation script, no metric/threshold or data split details).
  - Dependency/config details missing (ruptures/hmmlearn versions, config keys, train/test windows, data_loader touchpoints).
  - Proxy handoff saved to `AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki0_STATE-001_PROXY_PLAN_20251230_033218.md`; CURRENT_STATUS not updated pending revised plan.

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): UNVERIFIED (KI0 profile missing; SYSTEM_STATUS.json missing, read SYSTEM_STATUS.md)
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw (global)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): state_label in {COOLDOWN, HOT, RECOVERY, NORMAL}
- Rule 4 (target metric): bet-selection (avoid COOLDOWN, prefer HOT)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): UNVERIFIED (validation command/script not specified or present)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw (global)
- Semantics: state_label {COOLDOWN, HOT, RECOVERY, NORMAL}
- Target metric: bet-selection

## Repro Commands
- UNVERIFIED (no runnable validation command or script provided)

# Proxy Review
- No KI0 proxy profile available; cannot check required guardrails or known integration points, so plan validation incomplete by definition.
- Plan stops at creating `kenobase/analysis/regime_detection.py` + config entry; no hook into pipeline/orchestrator/data flow, so feature would be unreachable (BUG-003 risk).
- Inputs for ruptures/HMM unspecified (draw numbers vs economic proxies like spieleinsatz/jackpot/CV), so produced labels could conflict with existing Axiom A7 semantics in `kenobase/core/economic_state.py`.
- Validation is non-operational: no metric/threshold, no train/test window spec, and the cited `scripts/validate_regime_detection.py` is absent.
- Dependency/config scope not defined (ruptures/hmmlearn versions, config keys, data_loader changes), leaving working-set coverage incomplete.
- CURRENT_STATUS not updated; awaiting revised architect plan before status logging.
