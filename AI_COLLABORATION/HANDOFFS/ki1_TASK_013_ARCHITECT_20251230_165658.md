summary:
  - HYP_003 Wochentag-Effekt: Test whether weekdays influence KENO draw outcomes
  - Existing temporal_cycles.py already has weekday analysis (used by HYP-011)
  - Requires dedicated HYP_003 script using Axiom-First approach
  - Test: Chi-square weekday vs uniform + ROI stratification by weekday
  - Nullmodell: Permutation test (shuffle dates, preserve draw structure)
  - Data: KENO_ab_2018.csv (historical) + KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv (recent)
  - Output: results/hyp003_weekday_effect.json
  - Acceptance: p<0.05 for deviation OR ROI_diff>20% between best/worst weekday

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): weekday=0-6, ROI per weekday
- Rule 4 (target metric): Chi-square p-value + ROI stratification
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_hyp003_weekday.py` -> `results/hyp003_weekday_effect.json`

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_hyp003_weekday.py` -> `results/hyp003_weekday_effect.json`
