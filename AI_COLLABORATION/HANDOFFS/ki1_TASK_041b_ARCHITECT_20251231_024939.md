status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_041b
role: ARCHITECT
phase: ARCHITECT
files_changed: []
summary:
  - Context sync: SYSTEM_STATUS.json shows WL-003 cooldown hypothesis BESTAETIGT
  - Existing data: weekday_roi_analysis.json shows Di +423% ROI (best day), all others negative
  - Existing data: v1_v2_cooldown_comparison.json shows V1 wins cooldown (2/3), V2 wins normal (3/3)
  - Interaction hypothesis: Di + normal = even higher ROI? vs Di + cooldown?
  - Implement 2x2 analysis grid: (Dienstag vs andere Tage) x (cooldown vs normal)
  - Use existing infrastructure from analyze_weekday_roi.py + backtest_v1_v2_cooldown.py
  - Output: results/dienstag_cooldown_interaction.json
  - Acceptance: 2x2 ROI table with statistical test for interaction effect

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-phase (cooldown vs normal) x per-weekday (Di vs other)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): cooldown = 1-30 days post-jackpot; Dienstag = weekday==1
- Rule 4 (target metric): ROI interaction effect (Di*cooldown)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (standalone script)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/validate_dienstag_cooldown.py` -> `results/dienstag_cooldown_interaction.json`
