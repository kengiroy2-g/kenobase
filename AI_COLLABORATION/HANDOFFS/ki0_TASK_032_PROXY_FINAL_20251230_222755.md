status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_032
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - High-Win Forensik script complete with 14 events analyzed from 2018-2024 backtest
  - Weekday distribution confirms Dienstag (6x) as most frequent high-win day
  - Birthday ratio 0.446 matches expected 0.443 - no anomaly (correctly null)
  - Permutation test p=0.571 - confirms no significant clustering vs random
  - Top ticket pair_focused [2,3,9,33,49,50] with 5x high-win events
  - 2 clusters identified (<=30 days threshold), gap analysis valid
  - All internal consistency checks pass (event counts, sums, dates)
  - Script follows Axiom-First: null model validates no exploitable pattern

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-event
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): high_win = Payout >= 400 EUR
- Rule 4 (target metric): pattern-detection
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_high_win_forensik.py` -> `results/high_win_forensik.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-event (14 high-win events from 2018-2024)
- Semantics: High-Win = Payout >= 400 EUR
- Target metric: Pattern-Detection (temporal clustering, weekday, birthday bias)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_high_win_forensik.py` -> `results/high_win_forensik.json`

# Proxy Final Review

## Validator Checks Verified
All critical aspects confirmed:
1. Script syntax: py_compile passes
2. JSON output: Valid structure with 14 events
3. Internal consistency: All sums and counts match
4. Null model: Permutation test p=0.571 (no clustering)
5. Semantics: Top ticket, weekday, birthday ratio verified

## User Acceptance Assessment
Analysis acceptable because:
1. **Axiom-First Compliance**: Uses permutation null model
2. **Honest Results**: Correctly reports no exploitable pattern
3. **Reproducible**: Clear command + JSON artifact
4. **Methodologically Sound**: All analyses properly validated

## DECISION: COMPLETE
