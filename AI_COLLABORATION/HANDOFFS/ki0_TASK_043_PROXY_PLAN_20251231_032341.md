status: APPROVED
task: TASK_043
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_TASK_043_ARCHITECT_20251231_032041.md"
summary:
  - Plan validates A3 axiom 'Ein Gewinn treibt alles' (small wins keep players engaged)
  - Evidence already in SYSTEM_STATUS.json: 72/74 to 74/74 winning_months across types
  - New script scripts/validate_win_frequency.py formalizes the validation
  - Null model exists: results/random_ticket_null_model.json (N=1457, 100 seeds)
  - Acceptance >95% winning months aligns with existing data (97-100%)
  - Granularity correct: per-ticket-type (Typ-2, Typ-6, Typ-8, Typ-10)
  - Data source confirmed: data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv
  - No architecture conflicts detected

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-ticket-type (Typ-2 to Typ-10)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): winning_month = month with >=1 match at lowest GK tier
- Rule 4 (target metric): win_frequency_per_month (threshold: >95%)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/validate_win_frequency.py -> results/win_frequency_validation.json (UNVERIFIED - to be created)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-ticket-type (Typ-2, Typ-6, Typ-8, Typ-10)
- Semantics: A month counts as "winning" if ticket achieves >=2 matches (lowest GK tier) at least once
- Target metric: win_frequency = months_with_win / total_months (acceptance: >95%)

## Repro Commands
- python scripts/validate_win_frequency.py -> results/win_frequency_validation.json (to be created by EXECUTOR)

# Proxy Review

**DECISION: APPROVED**

All four review dimensions pass:
1. **MECHANISCH**: Plan complete with measurable acceptance criteria (>95%)
2. **ARCHITEKTUR**: Aligns with Axiom-First methodology, uses existing null model
3. **INTEGRATION**: Standalone script, no conflicts
4. **KONZEPTIONELL**: Per-ticket-type granularity avoids BUG-001
