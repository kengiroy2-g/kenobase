summary:
  - Python syntax verified OK (py_compile passed)
  - JSON artifact valid with hyp002 section, conclusion=NOT_SIGNIFICANT
  - Chi-square N<5 guard implemented correctly (lines 405-408)
  - Script runs successfully, output matches expected format
  - HYPOTHESES_CATALOG updated: HYP_002 section at lines 61-66, 111-151
  - Changelog entry at line 467-472 documents NOT_SIGNIFICANT result
  - Sample size issue correctly documented (0 cooldown HW vs 1 normal HW)
  - All acceptance criteria met for HYP_002 test implementation

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-period (30-day windows post-jackpot vs normal)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): High-Wins >= 100 EUR; Cooldown = 30 days post-GK10_10
- Rule 4 (target metric): High-Wins frequency ratio (cooldown vs normal)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/backtest_post_jackpot.py` -> `results/post_jackpot_backtest.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-period (30-day windows)
- Semantics: High-Wins = wins >= 100 EUR per keno_quotes.py
- Target metric: High-Wins frequency ratio (cooldown vs normal)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/backtest_post_jackpot.py` -> `results/post_jackpot_backtest.json`

# Validation

## Tests Executed
| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Python syntax (py_compile) | PASS |
| JSON artifact structure | PASS - hyp002 section with correct keys |
| Script execution | PASS - outputs NOT_SIGNIFICANT with sample size warning |
| Line references (HYPOTHESES_CATALOG) | PASS - verified lines 61-66, 111-151, 467-472 |
| Chi-square guard logic | PASS - N<5 check at lines 405-408 |

## Conclusion
**APPROVED** - All acceptance criteria met. Implementation correctly identifies HYP_002 as NOT_SIGNIFICANT due to insufficient sample size (0 cooldown vs 1 normal high-wins).
