summary:
  - Created kenobase/core/normalizer.py with Zahlenraum-Normalisierung functions
  - Implemented normalize_number, denormalize_number for (n-min)/(max-min) transform
  - Implemented batch functions: normalize_numbers, denormalize_numbers
  - Implemented DrawResult integration: normalize_draw, normalize_draws
  - Implemented cross_game_distance for cross-lottery comparison (MAE)
  - Game ranges: KENO 1-70, Lotto 1-49, EuroJackpot 1-50
  - Bonus: EuroZahlen 1-12, Superzahl 0-9 normalized; KENO Plus5 skipped
  - All 43 unit tests passing

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-game
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): (n - min) / (max - min) -> [0.0, 1.0]
- Rule 4 (target metric): cross-lottery correlation enablement
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_normalizer.py -v` -> 43 passed

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-game (KENO, Lotto, EuroJackpot)
- Semantics: normalized = (n - min) / (max - min)
- Target metric: cross-lottery correlation analysis

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_normalizer.py -v` -> 43 passed in 0.43s

# Umsetzung

Created `kenobase/core/normalizer.py` with:
- `normalize_number(n, game_type)` - single number to [0.0, 1.0]
- `denormalize_number(norm, game_type)` - back to original range
- `normalize_numbers(numbers, game_type)` - batch normalization
- `normalize_draw(draw)` - DrawResult integration
- `cross_game_distance(a, game_a, b, game_b)` - MAE distance

Updated `kenobase/core/__init__.py` with exports.

Created `tests/unit/test_normalizer.py` with 43 tests, all passing.
