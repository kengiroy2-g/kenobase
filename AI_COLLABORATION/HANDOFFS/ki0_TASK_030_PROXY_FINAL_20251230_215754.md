status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_030
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - Block-Permutation implementation verified complete at kenobase/analysis/null_models.py L152-210
  - NullModelType.BLOCK_PERMUTATION enum integrated at kenobase/core/axioms.py L23
  - NullModelRunner dispatch logic at L407-408 correctly routes to block_permutation
  - All 27 unit tests PASS including 4 dedicated TestBlockPermutation tests
  - Functional behavior verified: block order shuffled, intra-block sequence preserved, reproducible with seed
  - Edge cases handled: empty data returns empty, remainder blocks processed correctly
  - Implementation aligns with Axiom-First framework requirements for null model testing
  - Task APPROVED - no escalation needed

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (null model framework)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): block_size shuffles block order, preserves intra-block sequence
- Rule 4 (target metric): statistical validity of permutation tests
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_null_models.py -v` -> 27 passed

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (framework-level null model type)
- Semantics: block_size (default=7) shuffles block order, preserves within-block structure
- Target metric: statistical validity for permutation tests

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_null_models.py -v` -> 27 passed in 1.77s

# Proxy Final Review

**COMPLETE** - Validator thoroughly verified all acceptance criteria. Implementation is architecturally sound, well-tested, and ready for production use. No user escalation required.
