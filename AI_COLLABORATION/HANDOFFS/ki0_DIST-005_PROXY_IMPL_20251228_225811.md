status: APPROVED
task: DIST-005
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_IMPL
reviewed_handoff: "ki2_DIST-005_EXECUTOR_20251228_225411.md"
summary:
  - Syntax OK: Both distribution_synthesis.py and analyze_dist005.py pass py_compile
  - Pattern match: Implementation correctly follows house_edge_synthesis.py architecture
  - Graceful degradation: DIST-004 NO_DATA handled correctly (available=false, excluded from weighting)
  - Weighted average verified: (0.2559*0.30 + 0.96*0.25 + 0.7346*0.25) / 0.80 = 0.6255 CORRECT
  - Verdicts correct: STABLE (>=0.70), SUSPICIOUS (0.40-0.69), RANDOM (<0.40)
  - Output JSON valid: results/dist005_synthesis.json schema matches specification
  - CLI works: python scripts/analyze_dist005.py produces expected output
  - No Known Bugs triggered: No global thresholds (BUG-001), no integration issues

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (cross-hypothesis synthesis)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): evidence_score (0.0-1.0), verdict (STABLE/SUSPICIOUS/RANDOM)
- Rule 4 (target metric): overall distribution stability indicator
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_dist005.py` -> `results/dist005_synthesis.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (aggregates DIST-001/002/003/004 results)
- Semantics: evidence_score (0.0-1.0), verdict enum (STABLE/SUSPICIOUS/RANDOM)
- Target metric: Overall distribution stability indicator

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_dist005.py` -> `results/dist005_synthesis.json`
