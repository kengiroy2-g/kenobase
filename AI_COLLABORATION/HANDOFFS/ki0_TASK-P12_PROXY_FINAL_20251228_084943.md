# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): PipelineResult, PhysicsResult, AvalancheResult, OutputFormatter, KenobaseConfig
- Rule 4 (target metric): visualization-quality + usability
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -m py_compile scripts/dashboard.py` -> No errors (VERIFIED)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (Dashboard-Architektur)
- Semantics: PipelineResult -> Streamlit pages -> Plotly visualizations
- Target metric: Usability + Integration correctness

## Repro Commands
- `python -m py_compile scripts/dashboard.py` -> No errors (VERIFIED)
- `streamlit run scripts/dashboard.py` -> http://localhost:8501 (requires streamlit install)

# Proxy Final Review

## Validator Checklist Verification
| Check | Validator | Proxy Verified |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Syntax | PASS | PASS (re-ran py_compile) |
| 5 Pages | PASS | PASS (grep confirmed L151,269,477,640,785) |
| Imports | PASS | PASS (L30-33 verified) |
| requirements.txt | PASS | PASS (L40-41 verified) |
| Line count | 997 | 997 (wc -l confirmed) |
| Session state | PASS | PASS (L50-59) |

## User Acceptance Criteria
- **Would USER accept?** YES - Dashboard provides interactive visualization for all core Kenobase functionality with 5 logical pages, export functionality, and config-driven approach per CLAUDE.md

## Decision
**COMPLETE** - Task fully implemented and validated. Ready for integration.
