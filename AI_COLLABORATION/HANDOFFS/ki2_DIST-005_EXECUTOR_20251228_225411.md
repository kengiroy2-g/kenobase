files_changed:
  - kenobase/analysis/distribution_synthesis.py
  - scripts/analyze_dist005.py
  - results/dist005_synthesis.json
summary:
  - Created distribution_synthesis.py following house_edge_synthesis.py pattern
  - Implemented loaders for DIST-001/002/003/004 with graceful degradation
  - DIST-004 (popularity_proxy) correctly handled as NO_DATA (3/4 sources available)
  - Weighted average calculation excludes unavailable sources from weighting
  - Verdicts: STABLE (>=0.70), SUSPICIOUS (0.40-0.69), RANDOM (<0.40)
  - Overall score 0.6255 -> SUSPICIOUS verdict
  - CLI script analyze_dist005.py created with verbose output option
  - Output results/dist005_synthesis.json generated successfully

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (cross-hypothesis synthesis)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): evidence_score (0.0-1.0), verdict (STABLE/SUSPICIOUS/RANDOM)
- Rule 4 (target metric): overall distribution stability indicator
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_dist005.py` -> `results/dist005_synthesis.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (aggregates DIST-001/002/003/004 results)
- Semantics: evidence_score (0.0-1.0), verdict enum (STABLE/SUSPICIOUS/RANDOM)
- Target metric: Overall distribution stability indicator

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_dist005.py` -> `results/dist005_synthesis.json`

# Umsetzung

## Files Created

1. `kenobase/analysis/distribution_synthesis.py` - Core synthesis module
2. `scripts/analyze_dist005.py` - CLI script
3. `results/dist005_synthesis.json` - Generated output

## Execution Result

```
Data Sources: 3/4 available
  DIST-001: [OK] score=0.26 (high CV/anomalies)
  DIST-002: [OK] score=0.96 (stable fixed payouts)
  DIST-003: [OK] score=0.73 (mean OK, chi-square significant)
  DIST-004: [NO_DATA] - graceful degradation

Overall Evidence Score: 0.6255
Verdict: SUSPICIOUS
```
