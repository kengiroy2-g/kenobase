reviewed_handoff: "ki1_TASK-R01_ARCHITECT_20251228_055326.md"
summary:
  - Near-Miss module kenobase/analysis/near_miss.py exists (195 LOC) - verified
  - Integration in __init__.py lines 43-50 - verified  
  - Analysis script scripts/analyze_hyp001.py already exists (342 LOC) with full CLI
  - Script includes Distribution, Near-Miss, AND Reinforcement analyses (3-phase approach)
  - Unit tests for near_miss.py are missing - this is the only remaining work
  - Results export already implemented in analyze_hyp001.py (JSON output)
  - No architectural issues or global threshold bugs detected
  - Plan scope reduced: only Unit-Tests needed, script already done

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-keno-type
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): near_miss_ratio, expected_ratio, chi2_stat, p_value, is_significant
- Rule 4 (target metric): statistical significance (p < 0.05)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_hyp001.py --gq-file Keno_GPTs/Keno_GQ_2022_2023-2024.csv`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-keno-type (Keno-Typ 2-10)
- Semantics: NearMissResult dataclass
- Target metric: Chi-Square p-value < 0.05

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_hyp001.py --help`
- `python scripts/analyze_hyp001.py --gq-file Keno_GPTs/Keno_GQ_2022_2023-2024.csv --output AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/HYP-001_report.json`

# Proxy Review

**APPROVED** with scope correction. ARCHITECT plan was mostly accurate but overstated work:
- `scripts/analyze_hyp001.py` already exists (342 LOC)
- Only Unit-Tests for `near_miss.py` remain as deliverable
