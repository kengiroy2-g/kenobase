validated_handoff: "ki0_HYP-004_PROXY_IMPL_20251227_145409.md"
summary:
  - All 21 unit tests pass (pytest 0.93s)
  - Syntax check OK (py_compile)
  - JSON result file valid (289KB, correct structure)
  - Module imports verified (kenobase.analysis exports 12 new symbols)
  - analyze_hyp004.py script runs successfully
  - Acceptance Criteria: r=0.0497, p=0.683 -> HYP-004 NOT SUPPORTED
  - Only 2.0% of 2208 rolling windows (45) show supporting evidence
  - Conclusion: NO EVIDENCE for inverse correlation hypothesis

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (per-number across all 70 KENO numbers)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): popularity=GQ winner counts, frequency=draw appearances
- Rule 4 (target metric): Spearman correlation r < -0.2 with p < 0.05
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_hyp004.py` -> data/results/hyp004_correlation.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (all 70 KENO numbers)
- Semantics: popularity from GQ winners, frequency from draws
- Target metric: Spearman r < -0.2 AND p < 0.05

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_popularity_correlation.py -v` -> 21 passed
- `python scripts/analyze_hyp004.py` -> data/results/hyp004_correlation.json

# Validation

**Implementation APPROVED.** Scientific finding: HYP-004 falsified (r=0.05, p=0.68 - no inverse correlation).
