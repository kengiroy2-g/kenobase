summary:
  - Added SumWindowsConfig to config.py with enabled, bin_width, expected_mean, manual_min_sum/max_sum
  - Created combination_filter.py bridge module with SumBounds dataclass and derive functions
  - Extended PipelineRunner.run() with Step 2.5 Sum Distribution Analysis
  - Added _run_sum_analysis() method that analyzes sums and derives bounds from clusters
  - Extended PipelineResult with sum_distribution_result and sum_bounds fields
  - Created 13 unit tests for combination_filter module (all passing)
  - Integration verified: Pipeline correctly derives bounds [605-825] from KENO data

- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): min_sum/max_sum from SumCluster.range_min/range_max
- Rule 4 (target metric): filter effectiveness
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_combination_filter.py -v` -> 13 passed

## Repro Commands
