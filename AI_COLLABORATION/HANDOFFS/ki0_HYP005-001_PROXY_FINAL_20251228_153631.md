status: COMPLETE
task: HYP005-001
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - All 18 unit tests PASSED (verified)
  - Script analyze_index_reset.py runs end-to-end successfully
  - p-Value 0.0419 < 0.05 - Acceptance Criteria MET
  - Per-number granularity correctly maintained (70 numbers tracked)
  - JSON output validated with full statistical results
  - Uses existing calculate_index_correlation() (no code duplication)
  - Effect size (Cohen's d = 0.063) indicates small but statistically significant effect
  - USER-ACCEPTABLE: Clean implementation, well-tested, meets all criteria

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-number (70 Keno numbers)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): Index = count(appearances) since last GK1-Reset
- Rule 4 (target metric): t-Test p-Value < 0.05
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_index_reset.py` -> `results/hyp005_index_reset.json` VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-number (70 Keno numbers individually tracked)
- Semantics: Index = appearance count since last GK1 event reset
- Target metric: t-Test p-Value < 0.05

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_index_reset.py` -> `results/hyp005_index_reset.json` (VERIFIED)
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_number_index.py -v` -> 18/18 PASSED (VERIFIED)

# Proxy Final Review

## Final Decision: **COMPLETE**

All acceptance criteria met:
- p-Value 0.0419 < 0.05 (statistically significant)
- 18/18 unit tests passing
- Clean JSON output with full segment details
- Per-number granularity maintained

No escalation required - task ready for closure.
