summary:
  - Walk-Forward claims spread across 3 result files + 2 documentation files
  - HYP_006 claims 30.9% ROI frequency strategy - artifact exists but needs verification
  - Lookback grid shows ALL delta_roi=0.0 (rules=baseline) - no strategy improvement
  - v1_v2_performance_synthesis claims +53.24% ROI requires Walk-Forward validation
  - Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction implemented, 0/35 significant results
  - Scripts reproducible: walk_forward_lookback_grid.py, analyze_ticket_lifecycle.py
  - CRITICAL: Contradictory claims need reconciliation (30.9% vs 0.0% delta)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-strategy (frequency, frequency_high, v2_style) + per-type (Typ-6 to Typ-10)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): ROI = ((won - invested) / invested) * 100%, delta_roi = rules_roi - baseline_roi
- Rule 4 (target metric): ROI improvement (delta_roi) with FDR-corrected significance
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/walk_forward_lookback_grid.py` -> `results/walk_forward_lookback_grid.json`

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/walk_forward_lookback_grid.py --output results/walk_forward_lookback_grid.json` -> EXISTS
- `python scripts/analyze_ticket_lifecycle.py` -> `results/ticket_lifecycle_analysis.json`
