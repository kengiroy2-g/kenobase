status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_039c
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - Validator APPROVED all checks: syntax, JSON structure, cycle semantics
  - 68 cycles x 3 types = 204 comparisons verified
  - Non-overlapping 28-day cycles confirmed (0 overlaps)
  - Per-cycle fields complete: cycle_idx, dates, ROI, delta, winner
  - Delta accuracy verified: 0/68 fails within 0.02 tolerance
  - Winner aggregation correct: 83+106+15=204
  - Overall winner V2 (106 > 83) correctly determined
  - Reproducible: python scripts/compare_v1_v2_cycles.py -> results/v1_v2_cycle_comparison.json

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-28-day-cycle
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): cycle_idx, cycle_start_date, cycle_end_date, num_draws, v1/v2 ROI, delta, winner
- Rule 4 (target metric): ROI per cycle (V1 vs V2 delta)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/compare_v1_v2_cycles.py -> results/v1_v2_cycle_comparison.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-28-day-cycle (non-overlapping, stride=28)
- Semantics: cycle_idx (0-indexed), cycle_start_date, cycle_end_date, num_draws, v1/v2 ROI, delta, winner
- Target metric: Per-cycle ROI delta (positive = V2 better)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/compare_v1_v2_cycles.py` -> `results/v1_v2_cycle_comparison.json`

# Proxy Final Review

## Validator Coverage Check
All 7 validator checks passed - syntax, structure, semantics, non-overlapping, delta accuracy, aggregation, winner logic.

## User Acceptance
Task delivers per-28-day-cycle V1 vs V2 comparison. Output format consistent with project standards. No architectural decisions required.

## Spot-Check (Proxy)
Verified JSON: 5 keys, 68 cycles per type, summary shows V2 wins 106 vs 83.

## Final Decision
**COMPLETE** - Task fully meets acceptance criteria.
