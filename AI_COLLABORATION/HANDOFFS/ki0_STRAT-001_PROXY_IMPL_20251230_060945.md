status: APPROVED
task: STRAT-001
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_IMPL
reviewed_handoff: "ki2_STRAT-001_EXECUTOR_20251230_060144.md"
summary:
  - All 4 files created: cross_game_timing.py (432 lines), CLI script (249 lines), tests (316 lines), results JSON
  - 15/15 unit tests passing (verified via pytest run)
  - Python syntax verified clean (py_compile OK)
  - Results JSON valid with 2 signals tested, 0 significant (as expected for schedule-only timing)
  - Key insight documented: null_std=0 exposes weekly pattern confounding - schedule-alone insufficient
  - Architecture correctly follows Axiom-First (TRANS-005): timing-based paradigm, not pattern-based
  - Module NOT exported from analysis/__init__.py (minor integration gap - see NOTE below)
  - No BUG-001/BUG-003 violations for core functionality; CLI works via direct import path

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-game-pair (KENO vs LOTTO/AW)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): timing_signal, lag_days, hit_rate_favorable, permutation_test
- Rule 4 (target metric): hit_rate_improvement_pct
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_cross_game_timing.py -k data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv -o results/cross_game_timing.json` -> results/cross_game_timing.json (VERIFIED)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-game-pair (KENO as target, LOTTO/AUSWAHLWETTE as sources)
- Semantics: is_lotto_draw_day, is_auswahlwette_draw_day, post_*_lag7, hit_rate_improvement_pct
- Target metric: hit_rate_improvement_pct (validated via permutation test)

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_cross_game_timing.py -v` -> 15 passed in 1.75s
- `python scripts/analyze_cross_game_timing.py -k data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv -o results/cross_game_timing.json`

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

## Verification Summary
| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Syntax (py_compile) | PASS | cross_game_timing.py compiles clean |
| Unit Tests | 15/15 PASS | 1.75s runtime |
| JSON Output | VALID | 2 signals tested, 0 significant |
| Architecture | COMPLIANT | Follows Axiom-First paradigm |
| Integration | PARTIAL | Works via direct import; not in __init__.py |

## Key Finding
The analysis correctly identified that **schedule-only timing signals are confounded with weekly patterns** (null_std=0 in permutation test). This validates the executor's conclusion that outcome-based coupling analysis is needed, not just draw-day timing.

## Decision
**APPROVED** - Implementation is functionally correct and architecturally sound. Ready for Validator phase.
