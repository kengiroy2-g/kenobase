status: APPROVED
task: STRAT-001
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_STRAT-001_ARCHITECT_20251230_055644.md"
summary:
  - Plan builds correctly on TRANS-005 conclusion: Pattern->Timing paradigm shift validated
  - Ecosystem-Graph shows 1 robust edge (KENO->AUSWAHLWETTE lag=7, lift=2.41) - cross-game timing has empirical basis
  - Existing code strategy_from_ecosystem.py (489 lines) handles single-game (KENO) timing well
  - Extension to multi-game timing (Lotto/EW draw schedules) is architecturally sound
  - Schedule-preserving permutation as nullmodel follows Axiom-First rules (Rule 4)
  - Target metric (hit_rate_improvement_pct) is measurable and aligns with existing ev_summary pattern
  - Granularity per-game-pair is correct given sparse edges in ecosystem graph
  - No BUG-001/BUG-003 violations detected

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-game-pair (KENO vs LOTTO/AW/EW)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): timing_signal, lag_days, draw_schedules, hit_rate
- Rule 4 (target metric): hit_rate_improvement_pct
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_cross_game_timing.py --output results/cross_game_timing.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-game-pair
- Semantics: timing_signal, lag_days, draw_schedules, hit_rate, ev_multiplier
- Target metric: hit_rate_improvement_pct

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_cross_game_timing.py --output results/cross_game_timing.json` (planned)
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_cross_game_timing.py -v` (planned)

# Proxy Review

**APPROVED** - Plan is mechanically complete, architecturally aligned with existing `strategy_from_ecosystem.py` code, and follows Axiom-First workflow. The schedule-preserving permutation nullmodel is correct for temporal validation. Ready for EXECUTOR phase.
