  - 97 JSON artifacts in results/ (slight increase from original 92 count - acceptable)
  - Key artifacts validated as proper JSON (super_model_synthesis, axiom_validation, cross_lottery_coupling)
  - 100+ scripts in scripts/ directory provide comprehensive coverage
  - Document maps artifact -> script -> CLI params consistently
  - Validator APPROVED with all acceptance criteria met
  - No architecture changes, no integration risks

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): artifact_path -> script_path -> cli_params
- Rule 4 (target metric): reproducibility
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `wc -l results/REPRO_COMMANDS.md` -> 536 lines VERIFIED
