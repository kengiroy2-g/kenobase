status: APPROVED
task: HOUSE-005
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_HOUSE-005_ARCHITECT_20251228_211506.md"
summary:
  - HOUSE-005 synthesizes 4 house-edge hypothesis results into unified report
  - Dependency mapping verified: HOUSE-001=hyp015_jackpot_correlation.json (EXISTS)
  - HOUSE-002=house002_stake_popularity.json (EXISTS)
  - HOUSE-003=house003_rolling_stability.json (EXISTS)
  - HOUSE-004=house004_near_miss_jackpot.json (MISSING - must run analyze_house004.py first)
  - Plan is architecturally sound with dataclasses and weighted scoring
  - BLOCKER: Executor must run analyze_house004.py before synthesis
  - Repro: python scripts/analyze_house005.py -> results/house005_synthesis_report.json

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): HouseEdgeSynthesisReport, evidence_score (0.0-1.0)
- Rule 4 (target metric): manipulation_evidence_score
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_house005.py` -> `results/house005_synthesis_report.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (aggregates 4 hypothesis results)
- Semantics: evidence_score = weighted sum of 4 hypothesis support indicators
- Target metric: manipulation_evidence_score (0.0-1.0)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_house004.py` -> `results/house004_near_miss_jackpot.json` (PREREQUISITE)
- `python scripts/analyze_house005.py` -> `results/house005_synthesis_report.json`

# Proxy Review

**APPROVED** - All 4 review dimensions pass:
1. MECHANISCH: Clear steps, measurable acceptance criteria
2. ARCHITEKTUR: Consistent with existing synthesis patterns
3. INTEGRATION: New files only, no modifications to existing code
4. KONZEPTIONELL: No Known Bugs triggered (global aggregation is intentional)

**Blocker:** Executor must run `python scripts/analyze_house004.py` first to generate missing HOUSE-004 results before synthesis.
