summary:
  - CONFIRMED previous rejection via independent Python recalculation
  - Document formula (Line 34) is WRONG: uses C(20,k)*C(50,n-k) instead of C(n,k)*C(70-n,20-k)
  - 8/9 KENO types have ROI errors ranging from +1pp to +24pp
  - Only Typ 10 within 0.3pp tolerance (49.66% vs 49.40%)
  - Typ 8 worst: doc 21.31% vs correct 43.25% (+21.94pp)
  - Typ 7: doc 25.66% vs correct 49.57% (+23.91pp)
  - Probability odds errors for Typ 8/8 (1:230,115 vs 1:74,941) and Typ 7/7 (1:40,979 vs 1:15,464)
  - AC2 (probabilities) FAIL, AC4 (ROI) FAIL - document requires complete recalculation

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-keno-type
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): P(k|n) = C(n,k)*C(70-n,20-k)/C(70,20), ROI = Σ P(k)*Quote_k
- Rule 4 (target metric): mathematical accuracy
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -c "..."` -> 43.25% (doc: 21.31%) FAIL

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-keno-type (Types 2-10)
- Semantics: Hypergeometric probability P(k matches | n picks, 20 drawn, 70 total)
- Target metric: Mathematical accuracy of probability and ROI values

## Repro Commands
- `python -c "from math import comb; p=lambda n,k:comb(n,k)*comb(70-n,20-k)/comb(70,20); print(f'{sum(p(8,k)*q for k,q in {8:10000,7:100,6:15,5:2,4:1}.items())*100:.2f}%')"` -> 43.25% (doc: 21.31%) FAIL

# Validation

**Result: REJECTED**

Independent verification confirms document `docs/keno_quotes.md` contains systematic mathematical errors:

| Issue | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Wrong formula Line 34 | Uses C(20,k)*C(50,n-k) instead of C(n,k)*C(70-n,20-k) |
| 8/9 ROI values wrong | Only Typ 10 within 0.3pp tolerance |
| Odds errors | Typ 8/8: doc 1:230,115 vs correct 1:74,941 |
| AC2 FAIL | Probability calculation errors |
| AC4 FAIL | ROI calculation errors |

**Key Finding:** All KENO types should have ~50% ROI (which is the legal requirement in Germany). The document shows ROIs from 21% to 56%, which is mathematically impossible for a regulated lottery.

**Next Action:** Return to EXECUTOR for complete recalculation with correct formula.
