reviewed_handoff: "ki1_HOUSE-005_ARCHITECT_20251228_211006.md"
summary:
  - HOUSE-005 synthesizes HOUSE-001 through HOUSE-004 results
  - CRITICAL: Missing prerequisite results - house001*.json and house004*.json not found
  - Only house002 and house003 results exist in results/ folder
  - Cannot proceed with synthesis without all 4 input files
  - Architect WORKING_SET_REQUEST mentions hyp015_jackpot_correlation.json (HYP-015) instead of HOUSE-001
  - HOUSE-001 and HOUSE-004 tasks must complete first
  - Plan is architecturally sound but blocked by missing dependencies

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): hypothesis_supported, evidence_score, confidence_level
- Rule 4 (target metric): manipulation_evidence_score
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): UNVERIFIED - missing input files block execution

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (synthesis of 4 hypothesis results)
- Semantics: hypothesis_supported (bool), evidence_score (0.0-1.0), confidence_level (str)
- Target metric: manipulation_evidence_score (0.0-1.0)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_house005.py` -> `results/house005_synthesis_report.json`
- BLOCKED: Missing `results/house001*.json` and `results/house004*.json`

# Proxy Review

**REJECTED** - Missing dependency artifacts.

The synthesis task HOUSE-005 cannot proceed because:
1. `results/house001*.json` - NOT FOUND
2. `results/house004*.json` - NOT FOUND

Only HOUSE-002 and HOUSE-003 results exist. The architect's plan must be returned for dependency resolution before HOUSE-005 can execute.
