summary:
  - All 26 tests pass (pytest verified: 26 passed in 1.72s)
  - spread_index.py follows parity_ratio.py pattern correctly (frozen dataclasses, chi-square, guardrail)
  - Syntax verified with py_compile for both source and tests
  - Formula (Max-Min)/Max correctly implemented, normalized to [0,1]
  - __init__.py exports all 6 symbols correctly (lines 318-325 import, 612-618 __all__)
  - SpreadBin and SpreadIndexResult dataclasses match established pattern
  - Guardrail: 15% deviation threshold (configurable) correctly implemented
  - No integration issues - module is standalone analysis helper

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): SpreadIndex = (Max-Min)/Max, range [0,1], bins for distribution
- Rule 4 (target metric): distribution validation via chi-square test
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_spread_index.py -v` -> 26 passed in 1.72s

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_spread_index.py -v` -> 26 passed in 1.72s
- `python -m py_compile kenobase/analysis/spread_index.py` -> SYNTAX OK
