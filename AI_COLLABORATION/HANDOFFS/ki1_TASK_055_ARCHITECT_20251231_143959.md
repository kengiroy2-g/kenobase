**ARCHITECT HANDOFF COMPLETE**

Created: `AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki1_TASK_055_ARCHITECT_20251231_143959.md`

**Summary:**
- Corrected the workflow per PROXY feedback: two-step process required
- Step 1: `backtest_high_payout_tickets.py --threshold 451` generates filtered events
- Step 2: `analyze_high_win_forensik.py --backtest <step1_output>` runs forensik
- Output artifact: `results/high_win_forensik_gt450.json`
- All repro commands verified against actual script arguments (lines 249-252 for backtest, lines 403-429 for forensik)
