status: COMPLETE
task: VALID-001
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - All 6 tests pass (pytest 2.65s verified by Validator)
  - CrossGameRule dataclass frozen=True at line 33 in cross_game_rule_backtester.py
  - Test file tests/unit/test_frozen_rules_invariant.py (342 lines, 6 tests)
  - Frozen-rules invariant validated: backtest receives rules externally, no mining
  - Data leakage prevention verified (train dates <= train_end)
  - Rule immutability enforced via FrozenInstanceError
  - Implementation aligns with CLAUDE.md Section 3.0 Axiom-First approach
  - No architecture decisions needed - straightforward test implementation

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): CrossGameRule frozen on Train, passed to backtest without re-mining
- Rule 4 (target metric): Out-of-Sample rule accuracy lift
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_frozen_rules_invariant.py -v` -> 6 passed VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global
- Semantics: Frozen rules pattern - rules mined on Train are immutable when applied to Test
- Target metric: Test validation (all 6 tests pass)

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_frozen_rules_invariant.py -v` -> 6 passed in 2.65s VERIFIED

# Proxy Final Review

## Validator Coverage
All critical aspects verified by Validator (ki7):
- Tests: 6/6 pass
- Code quality: No mypy/linting errors in test file
- Invariant: Rules passed externally, no mining in backtest
- Immutability: FrozenInstanceError on mutation

## User Acceptance
Implementation acceptable:
- Comprehensive test coverage (6 tests, multiple angles)
- Aligned with CLAUDE.md Section 3.0
- No breaking changes (new test file only)
- Clear documentation

## Architecture Questions
**None** - No user decisions required.

## Final Decision
**COMPLETE** - Task VALID-001 fully implemented and validated.
