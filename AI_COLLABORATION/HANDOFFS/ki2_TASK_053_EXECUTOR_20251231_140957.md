files_changed:
  - scripts/analyze_typ10_highwin.py
  - results/typ10_highwin_forensik.json
summary:
  - Created scripts/analyze_typ10_highwin.py (346 lines) based on analyze_typ9_highwin.py template
  - Script computes exact combinatorial probabilities for Typ-10 high-wins (9/10, 10/10)
  - Uses kenobase/core/keno_quotes.py as single source of truth (9/10=1000, 10/10=100000 EUR)
  - P(9/10)=2.12e-05 (wait ~47,237 draws), P(10/10)=4.66e-07 (wait ~2.1M draws)
  - With N=2237 draws: expected 0.047 events for 9/10, expected 0.001 events for 10/10
  - Poisson test: P(0 events|9/10)=95.4%, P(0 events|10/10)=99.9% - absence consistent
  - Baseline comparison to Typ-6,7,8,9 included for consistency validation
  - Output written to results/typ10_highwin_forensik.json

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (per-draw, all historical data)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): high-win = 9/10 (1.000 EUR) OR 10/10 (100.000 EUR) hits; payout from keno_quotes.py:25
- Rule 4 (target metric): null-hypothesis p-value (consistency with expectation)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (standalone forensik script)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_typ10_highwin.py` -> `results/typ10_highwin_forensik.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (all historical draws)
- Semantics: Typ-10 high-win = 9/10 OR 10/10 hits; payouts per kenobase/core/keno_quotes.py:25
- Target metric: Poisson p-value for observing 0 events given expected count

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_typ10_highwin.py` -> `results/typ10_highwin_forensik.json`

# Umsetzung

Script created and validated. Key findings:
- P(9/10)=2.12e-05, P(10/10)=4.66e-07 (corrected from ARCHITECT estimates)
- 0 Typ-10 high-win events observed in 2,237 draws is statistically expected
- Baseline comparison to Typ-6,7,8,9 shows consistent pattern (rarer events = fewer observed)
