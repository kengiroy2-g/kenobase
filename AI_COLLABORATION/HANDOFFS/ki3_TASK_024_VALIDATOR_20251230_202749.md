status: APPROVED
task: TASK_024
role: VALIDATOR
phase: VALIDATOR
validated_handoff: "ki0_TASK_024_PROXY_IMPL_20251230_202549.md"
summary:
  - Syntax check passed (py_compile, no errors)
  - Script reproducible with --seed 42, output matches stored JSON
  - N=1456 observations, mean overlap=5.749 (expected 5.714, diff<0.1)
  - Max |r|=0.0684 at lag=4, below 0.1 threshold (weak signal)
  - Permutation tests significant at lag=4 (p=0.009) and lag=7 (p=0.044)
  - Ljung-Box Q=13.56, df=7, p=0.059 (marginally non-significant)
  - Decision logic Axiom-First compliant: SUPPORT via permutation test significance
  - Block-permutation null model with 7-day blocks preserves weekly structure

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (time series)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): overlap_count = |numbers_t ∩ numbers_{t-1}|, Pearson autocorrelation r at lags 1-7
- Rule 4 (target metric): autocorrelation magnitude |r|, permutation p-value
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (standalone script)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/test_hyp014_overlap_autocorrelation.py --seed 42` -> `results/hyp014_overlap_autocorrelation.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (entire time series, N=1456)
- Semantics: overlap_count = intersection size between consecutive draws; Pearson autocorrelation at lag 1-7
- Target metric: |r| < 0.1 for random; permutation test p < 0.05 for significance

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/test_hyp014_overlap_autocorrelation.py --seed 42` -> `results/hyp014_overlap_autocorrelation.json`

# Validation

All acceptance criteria passed:
1. **Syntax**: py_compile passed
2. **Reproducibility**: Output matches stored JSON with seed=42
3. **Sanity**: Mean overlap 5.749 ≈ expected 5.714
4. **Statistical methods**: Pearson autocorrelation, block permutation, Ljung-Box all correctly implemented
5. **Decision logic**: SUPPORT triggered by permutation test significance (Axiom-First compliant)
