phase: EXECUTOR
files_changed:
  - AI_COLLABORATION/KNOWLEDGE_BASE/HYPOTHESES_CATALOG.md
summary:
  - HYP_CYC_006 (High-Win-Clustering) documented as NICHT SIGNIFIKANT
  - Data verified in results/cycles_comprehensive_analysis.json lines 260-355
  - Sample sizes: PRE_JACKPOT=116, POST_JACKPOT=87, COOLDOWN=121, NORMAL=1133 (N=1457)
  - High-Wins extremely sparse: V2=3 total (all PRE_JACKPOT), ORIG=2 total (both NORMAL typ_10)
  - Chi-quadrat test not applicable (expected cells < 5)
  - HYPOTHESES_CATALOG.md updated: table count (3->4), detailed section added, changelog entry
  - No code changes required - documentation-only task as planned

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-phase (PRE_JACKPOT, POST_JACKPOT, COOLDOWN, NORMAL)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): v2_highwins (>=100 EUR), v2_rate_per_100
- Rule 4 (target metric): High-Win frequency clustering by cycle phase
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py` -> `results/cycles_comprehensive_analysis.json` VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-phase (4 phases)
- Semantics: High-Win = Gewinn >= 100 EUR per draw
- Target metric: High-Win Rate per 100 draws, clustering by phase

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py` -> `results/cycles_comprehensive_analysis.json` VERIFIED

# Umsetzung

Documentation-only task completed. HYP_CYC_006 documented as NICHT SIGNIFIKANT due to sample size limitation (V2=3, ORIG=2 high-wins in 1457 draws; Chi-quadrat not applicable with expected cells < 5).
