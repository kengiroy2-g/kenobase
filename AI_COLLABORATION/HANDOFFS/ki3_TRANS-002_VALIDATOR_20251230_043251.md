summary:
  - Targeted pytest for decade distribution passed (3/3) -> `AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/TRANS-002_decade_distribution_test.txt`.
  - Decade distribution maps bins, computes expected counts/chi-square, and flags >20% deviation with warnings (kenobase/analysis/decade_distribution.py:82-185).
  - Runner uses active number range, surfaces guardrail warnings without aborting, and emits decade metrics; CLI exports decades for JSON reports (kenobase/pipeline/runner.py:238-360; scripts/analyze.py:171-194).
  - Validator handoff created and `AI_COLLABORATION/RESULTS/CURRENT_STATUS.md` updated; SYSTEM_STATUS.json missing so Rule 1 remains UNVERIFIED.

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): UNVERIFIED (SYSTEM_STATUS.json missing; git status executed)
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): bins start/end/count/expected/relative_frequency/deviation_ratio/within_guardrail; chi_square; p_value; max_deviation_ratio; guardrail_breached; warnings
- Rule 4 (target metric): calibration (uniformity vs expected decade distribution)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python -m pytest tests/unit/test_decade_distribution.py -q -> AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/TRANS-002_decade_distribution_test.txt

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global
- Semantics: decade_distribution fields above applied to KENO draws using active number range and numbers_per_draw
- Target metric: calibration (uniformity deviation)

## Repro Commands
- python -m pytest tests/unit/test_decade_distribution.py -q -> AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/TRANS-002_decade_distribution_test.txt

# Validation
- Tests: pytest command above (3 passed; artifact stored).
- Code review: decade analysis computes bins/expected counts, chi-square, and guardrail flagging with warnings (kenobase/analysis/decade_distribution.py:82-185); runner integrates guardrail handling and attaches decade stats (kenobase/pipeline/runner.py:238-360); CLI export includes decade metrics/bins for JSON output (scripts/analyze.py:171-194). Missing SYSTEM_STATUS.json noted (Rule 1 UNVERIFIED).
