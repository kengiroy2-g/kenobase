summary:
  - All 16/16 unit tests pass (pytest tests/unit/test_payout_inference.py)
  - EXPECTED_ODDS count verified: 36 entries (all Keno-Typ 2-10 combinations)
  - CLI script syntax and structure verified (argparse, JSON output)
  - Output JSON structure correct: n_draws=13140, number_rankings=20
  - Dataclasses properly defined: PayoutInferenceResult, NumberUnpopularityResult, PayoutInferenceSummary
  - Integration with distribution.py verified (load_quote_details_data import OK)
  - Type hints and docstrings present throughout
  - low_popularity_count=0 from anomaly-based detection is expected (KENO has fixed odds)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw (aggregated to number-level)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): EXPECTED_ODDS[(keno_type, matches)] -> quote; z-score < -1.5 -> LOW_POPULARITY
- Rule 4 (target metric): unpopularity_ratio
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): pytest tests/unit/test_payout_inference.py -v -> 16 passed

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw (aggregated to number-level in NumberUnpopularityResult)
- Semantics: EXPECTED_ODDS[(keno_type, matches)] -> fixed quote
- Target metric: unpopularity_ratio (low_popularity_count / total_count per number)

## Repro Commands
- pytest tests/unit/test_payout_inference.py -v -> 16 passed in 0.85s
- python scripts/analyze_payout_inference.py --data Keno_GPTs/KENO_Quote_details_2023.csv --draws data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2018.csv -> results/payout_inference.json

# Validation
