summary:
  - Independent recalculation confirms ROI errors in 8/9 KENO types
  - Only KENO Typ 10 has approximately correct ROI (49.40% vs 49.66% documented)
  - Types 2-9 have errors ranging from -24pp to +6pp
  - Typ 7 worst error at -23.91pp (doc 25.66%, correct 49.57%)
  - Typ 8 error -21.94pp (doc 21.31%, correct 43.25%)
  - Typ 9 error +6.36pp (doc 56.41%, correct 50.05%)
  - Probability odds errors for Typ 8/8 (1:230,115 vs 1:74,941) and Typ 7/7 (1:40,979 vs 1:15,464)
  - Document requires complete recalculation before approval

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-keno-type (Types 2-10)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): ROI = sum(P(k)*Quote(k)), P(k) = C(20,k)*C(50,n-k)/C(70,n)
- Rule 4 (target metric): mathematical accuracy
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -c "..."` commands in handoff file

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-keno-type (Types 2-10)
- Semantics: Hypergeometric probability formula for KENO
- Target metric: Mathematical accuracy of documented ROI values

## Repro Commands
- See handoff file for full Python verification script
- Output path: `AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki3_QUOTE-001_VALIDATOR_20251228_181539.md`

# Validation

**Result: REJECTED**

8/9 KENO types have incorrect ROI values. The document's core claims are mathematically wrong:
- "Typ 9 best at 56%" → correct is 50.05%
- "Typ 8 worst at 21%" → correct is 43.25%

All KENO types actually cluster around 43-51% ROI, consistent with German lottery regulation (~50% payout).
