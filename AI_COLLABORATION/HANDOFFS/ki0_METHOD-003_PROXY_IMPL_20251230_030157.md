summary:
  - MI implementation verified at alternative_coupling.py:346-452 - formula correct
  - Histogram-based MI with log2 (bits) at lines 417-422
  - Permutation null model at lines 429-432 with n_permutations parameter
  - Exported in __all__ (line 764) - integration complete
  - Integrated in run_all_methods() at line 688
  - All 3 unit tests pass (pytest verified)
  - FDR correction available via apply_fdr_correction()
  - No code changes needed - task COMPLETE

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (cross-lottery pair-wise coupling)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): MI in bits = sum p(x,y) * log2(p(x,y) / (p(x)*p(y)))
- Rule 4 (target metric): coupling detection (p-value <= alpha after permutation test)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_alternative_coupling.py::TestMutualInformationLagged -v` -> 3 passed

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (cross-lottery pair-wise coupling)
- Semantics: MI in bits measuring information shared between lagged source and target series
- Target metric: coupling detection via permutation test p-value

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_alternative_coupling.py::TestMutualInformationLagged -v` -> 3 passed
