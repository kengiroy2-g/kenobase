summary:
  - Implemented phase-stratified HYP_013 script and ran on 1,457 draws (2022-01-03..2025-12-29) using 17 jackpots from timeline_2025.csv.
  - Overlap means by phase: PRE 5.79 (n=24, UNVERIFIED), POST 5.92 (n=38, UNVERIFIED), COOLDOWN 5.78 (n=274), NORMAL 5.73 (n=1120); all z-tests vs 5.714 non-significant after BH/Bonferroni.
  - Birthday ratios by phase: PRE 0.476, POST 0.453, COOLDOWN 0.456, NORMAL 0.435 (sample sizes as above); all z-tests vs 0.443 non-significant after corrections.
  - Global KW p-values: overlap 0.93, birthday_ratio 0.53; 6 pairwise MW tests per metric all p_adj >=0.87, no significant differences.
  - Overall means: overlap 5.75 (n=1456), birthday_ratio 0.440 (n=1455); HYP_013 rejected (no corrected significance).
  - Artifacts written to results/hyp013_overlap_birthday_phase.json and AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/hyp013_overlap_birthday_phase.md; repro command added to results/REPRO_COMMANDS.md.

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (phase-stratified)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): phase label + overlap_count + birthday_ratio (1..31 in overlap)
- Rule 4 (target metric): calibration
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/test_hyp013_overlap_birthday_phase.py --draws data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv --jackpots data/processed/ecosystem/timeline_2025.csv --output results/hyp013_overlap_birthday_phase.json -> results/hyp013_overlap_birthday_phase.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (phase-stratified)
- Semantics: overlap_count=|numbers_t INTERSECT numbers_{t-1}|; birthday_ratio=share of 1..31 in overlap when overlap>0; phases=PRE_JACKPOT/POST_JACKPOT/COOLDOWN/NORMAL
- Target metric: calibration (deviation vs expected overlap/birthday share and phase differences)

## Repro Commands
- python scripts/test_hyp013_overlap_birthday_phase.py --draws data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv --jackpots data/processed/ecosystem/timeline_2025.csv --output results/hyp013_overlap_birthday_phase.json -> results/hyp013_overlap_birthday_phase.json

# Umsetzung
- Berechnungen und Artefakte generiert wie oben; CURRENT_STATUS nicht editiert (per Vorgabe).
