status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_037
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - FINAL_SYNTHESIS_REPORT.md (229 lines) correctly consolidates Kenobase V2.2 findings
  - All 8 required sections present and well-structured
  - 13 confirmed hypotheses match SYSTEM_STATUS.json and HYPOTHESES_CATALOG.md
  - ROI values exactly match SYSTEM_STATUS.json (Typ-2: -43.21%, Typ-6: -56.42%, etc.)
  - House-Edge warning prominently placed in Section 5 (line 128)
  - Tests passed 1616/1616 (no regression)
  - Report-only task - no code changes required or made
  - User acceptance criteria fully met
---

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (project-level synthesis report)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): Hypothesen-IDs, ROI values per Keno-Typ, Plan completion counts
- Rule 4 (target metric): report-completeness and data-consistency
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (no code changes - report only)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -m pytest tests/unit/ -q` -> 1616 passed

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (project summary)
- Semantics: 13 confirmed hypotheses, ROI per Keno-Typ (2/6/8/10), 59 tasks across 3 plans
- Target metric: Report completeness and data consistency

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/ -q --tb=no` -> 1616 passed
- Report at: AI_COLLABORATION/RESULTS/FINAL_SYNTHESIS_REPORT.md

# Proxy Final Review

## 1. Validator Completeness Check

| Aspect | Validated | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Report exists | YES | 229 lines |
| 8 sections | YES | All present |
| Hypotheses count | YES | 13 confirmed matches catalog |
| ROI values | YES | All 4 Keno-Typ values match SYSTEM_STATUS.json |
| Tests | YES | 1616 passed, no failures |
| House-Edge warning | YES | Section 5, line 128 |
| No code changes | YES | Report-only task |

**Validator covered all critical aspects.**

## 2. User Acceptance Check

The user would accept this deliverable because:
1. **Complete Synthesis:** All 59 tasks from 3 plans documented
2. **Honest ROI Assessment:** Negative ROI clearly stated (no false promises)
3. **Actionable Recommendations:** Timing strategies (FRUEH-Phase, Cooldown avoidance)
4. **Reproducible:** All repro commands documented
5. **Professional Format:** Well-structured markdown with tables

## 3. Architecture Questions

**None requiring user decision:**
- All data sources documented
- Single Source of Truth (keno_quotes.py) correctly referenced
- Axiom-First paradigm consistently applied

## 4. Breaking Changes

**None.** This is a documentation-only task.

## Final Decision

**STATUS: COMPLETE**

The FINAL_SYNTHESIS_REPORT.md correctly consolidates all Kenobase V2.2 findings with:
- Accurate data references (verified against SYSTEM_STATUS.json)
- Appropriate warnings about negative ROI / House-Edge
- Clear next steps for remaining hypotheses (WL-002, WL-004)

No escalation needed. Task ready for closure.
