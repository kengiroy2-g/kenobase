status: APPROVED
task: DATA-001
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_DATA-001_ARCHITECT_20251230_011854.md"
summary:
  - Plan definition "Multi-Game Timeline (daily grid) bauen" mandates new core module
  - TimelineGrid approach (011854) matches plan intent - APPROVED
  - Existing _align_source_to_target() serves different purpose (event-to-event)
  - Daily grid enables COUPLE-001/002 (Transfer Entropy, Cross-Spectrum) downstream
  - Draw frequencies correctly identified: KENO=7/wk, Lotto=2/wk, EJ=2/wk
  - Forward-fill + NaN strategy appropriate for different draw schedules
  - Parquet export enables efficient downstream analysis
  - Estimate 6h reasonable for core module + tests + CLI

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-game (daily grid with game-specific draw masks)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): date=index, columns=game features, NaN=no-draw-day
- Rule 4 (target metric): alignment coverage / enable cross-game coupling analysis
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (new core module, not helper)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): UNVERIFIED (handoff lacks concrete repro commands - acceptable for ARCHITECT)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-game (KENO daily, Lotto Wed+Sat, EuroJackpot Tue+Fri)
- Semantics: TimelineGrid with daily index, game-specific presence columns, NaN for non-draw
- Target metric: Enable downstream tasks (COUPLE-001, COUPLE-002, VALID-001)

## Repro Commands
- PENDING (EXECUTOR phase will define)

# Proxy Review

**Decision: APPROVED** - TimelineGrid approach (ki1_DATA-001_ARCHITECT_20251230_011854.md) aligns with plan definition and downstream dependencies.
