status: APPROVED
task: TASK_006
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_IMPL
reviewed_handoff: "ki2_TASK_006_EXECUTOR_20251230_152253.md"
summary:
  - Module syntax verified: distribution.py compiles without errors
  - JSON result validated: distribution_analysis_2025.json is valid JSON
  - Module exports confirmed: analyze_distribution, detect_anomalies, create_summary in __init__.py (lines 35-42, 367-374)
  - Granularity correct: per-keno-type (2-10) and per-gewinnklasse (0-10 matches) as in DistributionResult dataclass
  - Key metrics present: CV=0.97 daily, CV=0.36 weekly, 17 jackpot-10 hits, avg interval 20.1 days
  - No code changes were needed - implementation was already complete
  - No Known Bugs triggered (BUG-001 to BUG-010) - this is analysis-only, no orchestrator/config changes
  - Integration verified: module properly exported in kenobase/analysis/__init__.py

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-keno-type and per-gewinnklasse
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): Gewinner=winner count, Auszahlung=payout EUR, CV=coefficient of variation
- Rule 4 (target metric): distribution stability (CV) and anomaly detection
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_distribution.py` -> `results/distribution_analysis_2025.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-keno-type (2-10) and per-gewinnklasse (0-10 matches)
- Semantics: CV (coefficient of variation), mean/std winners, skewness, kurtosis
- Target metric: distribution stability (CV) and anomaly detection

## Repro Commands
- `python -m py_compile kenobase/analysis/distribution.py` -> Syntax OK
- `python scripts/analyze_distribution.py` -> generates analysis output
