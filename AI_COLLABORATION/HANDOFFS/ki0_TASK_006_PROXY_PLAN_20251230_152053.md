summary:
  - Task already implemented: distribution.py (439 lines), analyze_distribution.py (440 lines) exist
  - Results exist: distribution_analysis_2025.json with CV=0.97 daily, CV=0.36 weekly
  - Granularity correctly set: per-keno-type (2-10) and per-gewinnklasse (0-10 matches)
  - Repro command verified structure: `python scripts/analyze_distribution.py`
  - Module covers: winner distribution, payout ratio, anomaly detection with CV/skewness/kurtosis
  - 2025 data analyzed: 362 draws, 17 jackpot-10 hits, avg interval 20.1 days
  - EXECUTOR task: verify script runs successfully, optionally add phase cycle detection (WL-003)
  - No Known Bugs triggered (analysis-only task, appropriate thresholds)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-keno-type and per-gewinnklasse
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): Gewinner=winner count, Auszahlung=payout, CV=coefficient of variation
- Rule 4 (target metric): distribution stability (CV) and anomaly detection
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_distribution.py` -> results/distribution_analysis.json

**Handoff created:** `AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki0_TASK_006_PROXY_PLAN_20251230_152053.md`
