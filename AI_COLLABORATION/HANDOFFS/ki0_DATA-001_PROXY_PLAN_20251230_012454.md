status: ESCALATE
task: DATA-001
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_DATA-001_ARCHITECT_20251230_011854.md"
summary:
  - Previous PROXY (012154) already ESCALATED with same conflict - still unresolved
  - Handoff content is incomplete (only summary, no detailed plan)
  - Two conflicting approaches: AlignmentQuality vs TimelineGrid
  - Existing code in cross_lottery_coupling.py:136-154 already works
  - Model Law B (Least-Action) favors minimal AlignmentQuality approach
  - No acceptance criteria defined in plan (ecosystem_analysis_plan.yaml:8-12)
  - Cannot APPROVE without USER decision on approach

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-game (daily grid or event-based)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): date alignment via bisect_right, lag_days
- Rule 4 (target metric): alignment coverage (not specified in task)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): UNVERIFIED (design phase, no code yet)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-game
- Semantics: date→draw mapping, NaN/forward-fill strategies
- Target metric: undefined (missing acceptance criteria)

## Repro Commands
- UNVERIFIED (design phase)

# Proxy Review

**BLOCKED: Unresolved ESCALATE from Previous Proxy**

The loop should not have continued after the previous ESCALATE was raised.

**DECISION NEEDED from USER:**

| Option | Approach | Effort | Principle |
|--------|----------|--------|-----------|
| **A** | AlignmentQuality (extend cross_lottery_coupling.py) | 3.5h | Least-Action ✓ |
| **B** | TimelineGrid (new kenobase/core/timeline.py) | 4-6h | Generisch |
| **C** | Combine both | 6-8h | Overkill? |

**My recommendation:** Option A (Least-Action principle from Model Law B)
