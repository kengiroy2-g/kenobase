phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_HYP-003_ARCHITECT_20251227_163113.md"
summary:
  - HYP-003 (Regionale Gewinnverteilung) cannot be validated - data unavailable
  - Keno_GQ_*.csv contains only aggregate data (no Bundesland split)
  - WON'T FIX recommendation is appropriate
  - Scraping regional lottery sites is out of scope (legally problematic, 8-12h effort)
  - HYP-010 already covers related analysis with available data
  - EXECUTOR should update KENOBASE_ISSUES.md to mark as WON'T FIX
  - Move to "Archiv" section with rationale
  - No code implementation needed - documentation update only
