status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_013
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - Validator handoff APPROVED - all checks passed
  - Script `scripts/analyze_weekday_roi.py` syntax OK, reproducible
  - Output `results/weekday_roi_analysis.json` valid JSON (N=1457 draws, 2022-2025)
  - ROI-Spread criterion PASS: 490.07% > 20% threshold
  - Chi-square p=1.0 expected (KENO draws daily, uniform weekday distribution)
  - Nullmodell p=0.374 correctly identifies ROI spread as NOT SIGNIFICANT
  - Root cause: single 6-hit (1000 EUR) on Tuesday drives entire spread
  - HYP_003 verdict: CONFIRMED (raw ROI) but NOT_SIGNIFICANT (statistically)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (per-weekday, 7 categories)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): weekday=0-6 (Mo-So), ROI per V2-Ticket Type 9
- Rule 4 (target metric): ROI stratification + Chi-square p-value + nullmodell p-value
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_weekday_roi.py` -> `results/weekday_roi_analysis.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (per-weekday stratification, 7 categories)
- Semantics: weekday=0-6 (Monday-Sunday), ROI computed per V2-Ticket Type 9
- Target metric: ROI per weekday + Chi-square for draw frequency + nullmodell p-value

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_weekday_roi.py` -> `results/weekday_roi_analysis.json`

# Proxy Final Review

## Final Decision: COMPLETE

**Validator covered all critical aspects.** User would accept this implementation because:

1. **Axiom-First compliant:** Includes nullmodell validation (1000 permutations)
2. **Honest conclusion:** Correctly reports NOT_SIGNIFICANT despite passing raw ROI criterion
3. **No overengineering:** Single-purpose standalone script
4. **No architecture questions:** Reuses existing modules, follows conventions

**Scientific conclusion:** The 490% ROI spread is a statistical artifact from a single 6-hit jackpot. Nullmodell p=0.374 means this effect is not exploitable.

**Handoff:** `AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki0_TASK_013_PROXY_FINAL_20251230_171759.md`
