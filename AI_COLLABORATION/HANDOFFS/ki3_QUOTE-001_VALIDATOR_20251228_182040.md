summary:
  - Document docs/keno_quotes.md still uses WRONG formula (Line 34)
  - Wrong formula: C(20,k)*C(50,n-k)/C(70,20)
  - Correct formula: C(n,k)*C(70-n,20-k)/C(70,20)
  - ROI errors in 8/9 KENO types (only Typ 10 within tolerance)
  - Error range: -1.05pp (Typ 2) to -23.91pp (Typ 7)
  - AC2 (probabilities) FAILED, AC4 (ROI) FAILED

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-keno-type
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): P(k|n) = C(n,k)*C(70-n,20-k)/C(70,20)
- Rule 4 (target metric): mathematical accuracy
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python validation script -> stdout

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-keno-type (Types 2-10)
- Semantics: Hypergeometric probability
- Target metric: Mathematical accuracy

## Repro Commands
- `python -c "from math import comb; ..."` -> stdout (validated)

# Validation

**Status: REJECTED**

The document `docs/keno_quotes.md` has NOT been corrected since previous validation. All errors remain:

| Typ | Doc ROI | Correct ROI | Error |
|-----|---------|-------------|-------|
| 7 | 25.66% | 49.57% | -23.91pp |
| 8 | 21.31% | 43.25% | -21.94pp |
| 6 | 29.80% | 49.74% | -19.94pp |
| 5 | 31.70% | 49.90% | -18.20pp |
| 10 | 49.66% | 49.40% | +0.26pp (OK) |

**AC2 (Probabilities):** FAILED
**AC4 (ROI):** FAILED

**Next Step:** Return to EXECUTOR for complete recalculation.
