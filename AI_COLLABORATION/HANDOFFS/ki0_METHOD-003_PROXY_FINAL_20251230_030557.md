status: COMPLETE
task: METHOD-003
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - MI implementation verified at alternative_coupling.py:346-452 - formula correct
  - Formula: MI = sum p(x,y) * log2(p(x,y) / (p(x)*p(y))) at lines 417-422
  - Permutation null model at lines 429-432 with configurable n_permutations
  - All 3 unit tests pass (pytest verified by Validator)
  - Integration complete: exported in __all__, integrated in run_all_methods()
  - Sanity check passed: identical series MI=2.83 bits (high), independent MI=0.45 bits (low)
  - FDR correction available via apply_fdr_correction()
  - No code changes needed - task COMPLETE

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (cross-lottery pair-wise coupling)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): MI in bits = sum p(x,y) * log2(p(x,y) / (p(x)*p(y)))
- Rule 4 (target metric): coupling detection (p-value <= alpha after permutation test)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_alternative_coupling.py::TestMutualInformationLagged -v` -> 3 passed

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (cross-lottery pair-wise coupling)
- Semantics: MI in bits measuring information shared between lagged source and target series
- Target metric: coupling detection via permutation test p-value

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_alternative_coupling.py::TestMutualInformationLagged -v` -> 3 passed

# Proxy Final Review

## Validator Coverage Assessment
Validator has thoroughly checked all critical aspects:
1. Formula correctness at lines 417-422 ✓
2. Permutation null model at lines 429-432 ✓
3. All 3 unit tests pass ✓
4. Integration in __all__ and run_all_methods() ✓
5. Sanity check (identical=2.83 bits, independent=0.45 bits) ✓
6. FDR correction available ✓

## User Acceptance
Implementation follows project standards with clean API, configurable parameters, proper edge case handling.

## Decision
**APPROVED** - Task METHOD-003 is COMPLETE. No code changes needed.
