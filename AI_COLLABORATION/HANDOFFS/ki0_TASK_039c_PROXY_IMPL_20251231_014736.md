status: APPROVED
task: TASK_039c
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_IMPL
reviewed_handoff: "ki2_TASK_039c_EXECUTOR_20251231_014436.md"
summary:
  - Syntax verified: python -m py_compile passes
  - JSON output valid: results/v1_v2_cycle_comparison.json (5 keys, 68 cycles)
  - Cycle semantics correct: 68 cycles x 28 days, non-overlapping, start_idx=365
  - Per-cycle fields present: cycle_idx, start/end dates, v1/v2 ROI, delta, winner
  - Summary aggregation correct: 204 comparisons (68 cycles x 3 types)
  - V2 wins overall: 106 vs 83 cycles (15 ties) - consistent with handoff
  - All imports verified: SuperModelV1, SuperModelV2, simulate_ticket exist
  - No Known Bugs triggered (BUG-001 N/A - no global thresholds)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-28-day-cycle
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): cycle_idx, cycle_start_date, cycle_end_date, num_draws, v1_roi, v2_roi, delta, winner
- Rule 4 (target metric): ROI per cycle (V1 vs V2 delta)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/compare_v1_v2_cycles.py` -> `results/v1_v2_cycle_comparison.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-28-day-cycle (non-overlapping, stride=28)
- Semantics: cycle_idx (0-indexed), cycle_start_date, cycle_end_date, num_draws, v1/v2 ROI, delta, winner
- Target metric: Per-cycle ROI delta (positive = V2 better)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/compare_v1_v2_cycles.py` -> `results/v1_v2_cycle_comparison.json`
