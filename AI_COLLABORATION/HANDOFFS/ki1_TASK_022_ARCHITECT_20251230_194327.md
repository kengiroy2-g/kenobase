status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_022
role: ARCHITECT
phase: ARCHITECT
files_changed: []
summary:
  - Context sync: read AI_COLLABORATION/SYSTEM_STATUS.md (Stand 2025-12-29); SYSTEM_STATUS.json missing; git status shows dirty worktree.
  - KI role reviewed: AI_COLLABORATION/KI_PROFILES/KI_1_LEAD_ARCHITECT.md; KI0 proxy profile still absent (blocker noted).
  - HYP_012 snapshot: results/overlap_statistics.json (N=1457, mean overlap 5.745 vs 5.714 expected, n_tests=15, Bonferroni alpha=0.00333, no significant results) -- repro pending.
  - Repro path: scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py uses data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv + data/processed/ecosystem/timeline_2025.csv, writes results/overlap_statistics.json and log AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/v4_runtime/TASK_022_overlap.log.
  - Implementation plan defined (input checks, repro+logging, metric validation, docs/status update, proxy/profile fix).

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): UNVERIFIED (SYSTEM_STATUS.json missing; read SYSTEM_STATUS.md + git status)
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): overlap_count=|numbers_set intersect prev_numbers|; overlap_birthday_ratio=birthday/overlap for overlap>0 per phase
- Rule 4 (target metric): calibration (observed vs expected overlap/birthday ratios)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py > AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/v4_runtime/TASK_022_overlap.log -> results/overlap_statistics.json (UNVERIFIED)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (phase-specific cuts for diagnostics)
- Semantics: previous-day overlap count per draw; birthday_ratio = share of {1..31} in overlap; phases=PRE_JACKPOT/POST_JACKPOT/COOLDOWN/NORMAL
- Target metric: calibration (deviation of observed overlaps from E[Overlap]=5.714; multiple-testing-adjusted significance)

## Repro Commands
- python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py > AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/v4_runtime/TASK_022_overlap.log -> results/overlap_statistics.json (UNVERIFIED)

# Implementierungsplan
1. Input checks: verify paths/encoding for data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv and data/processed/ecosystem/timeline_2025.csv (N, date parsing), log any anomalies.
2. Context artifacts: create/update AI_COLLABORATION/SYSTEM_STATUS.json from current SYSTEM_STATUS.md snapshot; confirm/create missing KI0 proxy profile per spec (flag blocker if spec absent).
3. Repro run: execute `python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py` in repo root, pipe stdout to AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/v4_runtime/TASK_022_overlap.log; ensure results/overlap_statistics.json and results/cycles_comprehensive_analysis.json regenerate.
4. Metric validation: extract HYP_012 metrics from results/overlap_statistics.json (N, mean, z, p, bonferroni_alpha, per-phase n/p) and compare to expected E[Overlap]=5.714 / E[Birthday]=0.443; mark significance correctly.
5. Documentation: update AI_COLLABORATION/RESULTS/CURRENT_STATUS.md or relevant hypothesis register with reproduced HYP_012 statement (paths, N, alpha, conclusion "no significant deviations" if confirmed) and link log/results.
6. QA/handoff: check logs for errors, record paths/checksums of outputs, and extend executor/validator handoff with repro commands, data sources, and open risks (e.g., missing KI0 spec).
