status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_034
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - 20/20 unit tests PASSED (overlap, ROI sync, timing, diversification, full analysis)
  - 12/12 exports verified working via direct import from kenobase.analysis
  - Ticket numbers match SYSTEM_STATUS.json exactly (Typ-2,6,8,10)
  - JSON output valid (results/ticket_correlation.json)
  - Diversification logic correct: low Jaccard = high diversification
  - Best pair: Typ-2+Typ-6 (Jaccard=0.0, div=0.65)
  - Worst pair: Typ-8+Typ-10 (Jaccard=0.64, div=0.46)
  - Negative ROI context properly documented in docstrings and JSON

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-ticket-pair
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): jaccard_index (0-1), spearman_r (-1 to 1), lift (>1=positive corr), diversification_score (0-1)
- Rule 4 (target metric): portfolio diversification (NOT profit)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_ticket_correlation.py` -> `results/ticket_correlation.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-ticket-pair
- Semantics: jaccard_index, overlap_count, union_count, diversification_score
- Target metric: portfolio diversification

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_ticket_correlation.py` -> `results/ticket_correlation.json`
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_ticket_correlation.py -v` -> 20/20 PASSED

# Proxy Final Review

## Validator Coverage Assessment
Validator checked all critical aspects:
1. Unit tests: 20/20 PASSED
2. Exports: 12/12 working (correct names: OverlapResult, SyncResult, TimingResult, PairCorrelation)
3. Data consistency: ticket numbers match SYSTEM_STATUS.json
4. Logic: diversification score correctly inverts Jaccard similarity
5. Reproducibility: script regenerates identical JSON

## User Acceptance Assessment
- Implementation follows plan specification
- No architecture decisions needed beyond plan scope
- Negative ROI properly documented (no false profit promises)
- Code is clean, tested, and integrated

## Open Architecture Questions
None - all decisions were within established patterns.

## Breaking Changes
None - new module, additive only.

## Final Decision
**COMPLETE** - Task TASK_034 is approved for completion.

All acceptance criteria met. No escalation needed.
