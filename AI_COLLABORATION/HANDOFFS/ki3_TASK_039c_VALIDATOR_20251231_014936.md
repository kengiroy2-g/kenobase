summary:
  - Syntax verified: python -m py_compile passes
  - JSON structure valid: 5 top-level keys, all required fields present
  - Cycle semantics verified: 68 cycles x 28 days, non-overlapping (0 overlaps)
  - Per-cycle fields verified: cycle_idx, start/end dates, num_draws, v1/v2 ROI, delta, winner
  - Delta accuracy verified: 0/68 fails (tolerance 0.02)
  - Winner aggregation verified: 83+106+15=204 matches 68x3
  - Overall winner logic correct: V2 (106 > 83)
  - Acceptance criteria met: per-28-day cycle comparison with ROI delta

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-28-day-cycle
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): cycle_idx, cycle_start_date, cycle_end_date, num_draws, v1/v2 ROI, delta, winner
- Rule 4 (target metric): ROI per cycle (V1 vs V2 delta)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/compare_v1_v2_cycles.py -> results/v1_v2_cycle_comparison.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-28-day-cycle (non-overlapping, stride=28)
- Semantics: cycle_idx (0-indexed), cycle_start_date, cycle_end_date, num_draws, v1/v2 ROI, delta, winner
- Target metric: Per-cycle ROI delta (positive = V2 better)

## Repro Commands
- python scripts/compare_v1_v2_cycles.py -> results/v1_v2_cycle_comparison.json

# Validation

## Tests Executed
1. **Syntax**: py_compile passes
2. **JSON structure**: 5 keys, required fields present
3. **Cycle count consistency**: 68 cycles across all types
4. **Non-overlapping**: 0 overlaps detected
5. **Delta accuracy**: 0/68 fails (0.02 tolerance)
6. **Winner aggregation**: 83+106+15=204 = 68*3 ✓
7. **Overall winner logic**: V2 (106>83) correctly declared
