status: COMPLETE
task: METHOD-005
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - All 16 unit tests pass (pytest verified by VALIDATOR in 1.69s)
  - Module number_representations.py verified complete (329 LOC)
  - Test file test_number_representations.py verified complete (261 LOC)
  - 5 representation types: sum, mean, centroid, presence_vector, normalized_vector
  - GameTimeSeries dataclass with pool_max supports cross-game normalization
  - align_time_series() and get_train_test_split() ready for TRANS-001..004
  - Pure transformation module - no architecture violations
  - No user escalation required

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): sum/mean/centroid/presence_vector/normalized_vector
- Rule 4 (target metric): enable Granger/DTW/MI/TE coupling analysis
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_number_representations.py -v` -> 16 passed (1.69s)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw
- Semantics: 5 representation types for time-series conversion
- Target metric: Enable downstream cross-lottery coupling analysis

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_number_representations.py -v` -> 16 passed (1.69s)
- `python -c "from kenobase.analysis.number_representations import *; print('Import OK')"` -> Import OK

# Proxy Final Review

**COMPLETE** - Task METHOD-005 approved.

VALIDATOR confirmed all 16 tests pass, module imports correctly, 329 LOC implementation + 261 LOC tests. Pure transformation module with no I/O or side effects. Ready for downstream TRANS-001..004 tasks.

No user escalation required - standard helper module following established patterns in `kenobase/analysis/`.
