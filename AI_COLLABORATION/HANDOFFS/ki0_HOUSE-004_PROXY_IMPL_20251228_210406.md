summary:
  - All 3 files created (near_miss_jackpot.py, analyze_house004.py, test_near_miss_jackpot.py)
  - Syntax validation passed for all files (py_compile OK)
  - All 20 unit tests passing (pytest 0.88s)
  - Module imports work correctly from kenobase.analysis
  - CLI --help verified working
  - Imports from dependency modules (jackpot_correlation, near_miss) verified
  - No global threshold issues - uses standard p<0.05 significance
  - Architecture consistent with existing house002/house003 patterns

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-keno-type (2-10) segmented by jackpot/non-jackpot periods
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): near_miss_ratio = near_winners / max_winners per segment
- Rule 4 (target metric): Chi-square significance test (p < 0.05)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_near_miss_jackpot.py -v` -> 20 passed (0.88s)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-keno-type (2-10), segmented by jackpot vs normal periods
- Semantics: near_miss_ratio = near_miss_winners / max_winners; jackpot dates from GK1 events
- Target metric: Chi-square p < 0.05 for at least 3 Keno-Typen

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_near_miss_jackpot.py -v` -> 20 passed (0.88s)
- `python scripts/analyze_house004.py --help` -> CLI verified

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

**APPROVED** - Implementation is correct, architecturally consistent, and all tests pass.
