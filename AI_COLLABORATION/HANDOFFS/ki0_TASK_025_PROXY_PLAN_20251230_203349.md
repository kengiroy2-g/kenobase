status: APPROVED
task: TASK_025
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_TASK_025_ARCHITECT_20251230_203049.md"
summary:
  - Plan extends existing backtest_frozen_position_rules.py with grid search
  - Existing script has ~13 tunable parameters (lines 84-111)
  - Architecture sound: reuses train->val->test split (no new leakage)
  - Output to results/walk_forward_param_grid.json (no conflict)
  - CONCERN: Multiple testing (100 grid x 5 types x 4 windows = 2000+ comparisons)
  - MITIGATION REQUIRED: Implement BH/FDR correction per CLAUDE.md Section 3.0
  - Repro command specified: python scripts/walk_forward_param_grid.py --output results/walk_forward_param_grid.json
  - Runtime estimate reasonable (~30min-1h for full grid)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-param-combo-per-keno-type
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): ROI, mean_hits, big_win_count, delta vs baseline
- Rule 4 (target metric): ROI (primary), big_win_count (secondary)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (extends existing backtester)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/walk_forward_param_grid.py --output results/walk_forward_param_grid.json` -> results/walk_forward_param_grid.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-parameter-combination-per-keno-type
- Semantics: ROI%, mean_hits, big_win_count, delta vs weighted-frequency baseline
- Target metric: ROI% improvement over baseline (primary)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/walk_forward_param_grid.py --output results/walk_forward_param_grid.json`
- Artifact: `results/walk_forward_param_grid.json`

# Proxy Review

**APPROVED** - Plan is architecturally sound. Extends existing frozen-rules backtester with itertools.product grid search. Required mitigation: implement BH/FDR correction for multiple testing (~2000+ comparisons).
