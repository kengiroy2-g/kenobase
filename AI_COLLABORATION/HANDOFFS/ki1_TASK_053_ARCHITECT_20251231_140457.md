role: ARCHITECT
phase: ARCHITECT
files_changed: []
summary:
  - Typ-10 high-win analyse (9/10=1.000 EUR, 10/10=100.000 EUR) requires new script
  - Existing pattern: scripts/analyze_typ9_highwin.py (Typ-9 template)
  - No Typ-10 high-win events exist in current forensik data (expected due to extreme rarity)
  - Probabilities: P(9/10)~3e-04, P(10/10)~1.5e-08 (needs ~66M draws for single 10/10)
  - Script should compute combinatorial probabilities and document null-result
  - Use keno_quotes.py as single source of truth (9/10=1.000, 10/10=100.000 EUR)
  - Output: results/typ10_highwin_forensik.json with Poisson null-hypothesis test
  - Baseline comparison to Typ-6,7,8,9 for consistency check

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (per-draw, all historical data)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): high-win = 9/10 OR 10/10 hits; payout from keno_quotes.py
- Rule 4 (target metric): null-hypothesis p-value (consistency with expectation)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (standalone forensik script)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_typ10_highwin.py` -> `results/typ10_highwin_forensik.json`
