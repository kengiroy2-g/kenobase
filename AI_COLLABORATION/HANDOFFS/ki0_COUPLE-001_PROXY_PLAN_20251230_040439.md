summary:
  - Handoff reviewed; new proxy file created: `AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki0_COUPLE-001_PROXY_PLAN_20251230_040439.md`.
  - Plan covers TE/CMI via kNN with lag grid, permutation nulls, BH/FDR per pair/lag, CLI surface, and synthetic directionality + smoke tests.
  - Acceptance criteria include JSON output with q-values and CLI run example; working set is specific (alternative_coupling, analyze_alternative_methods, number_representations, tests).
  - Risks: SYSTEM_STATUS.json missing; KI profile `ki0_proxy.md` not found, so integration guardrails/known bugs remain UNVERIFIED; CURRENT_STATUS not updated.

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): UNVERIFIED (SYSTEM_STATUS.json missing; CLAUDE.md read; git status run; KI profile missing)
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): source/target game pairs with lagged TE/CMI, permutation p/q, train/test split metadata, control flag
- Rule 4 (target metric): accuracy
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): UNVERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global
- Semantics: directed game pairs with TE/CMI per lag conditioned on target history and optional source history, permutation nulls, BH/FDR, ecosystem vs EuroJackpot control labeling
- Target metric: accuracy

## Repro Commands
- UNVERIFIED

# Proxy Review
- Plan is mechanically complete (scope, estimators, nulls, BH/FDR, CLI/test coverage) and aligns with axiom-first separation of EuroJackpot as control.
- No red-flag global thresholds; corrections per pair/lag mitigate BUG-001; CLI integration and tests cover known integration points inferred from working set.
- Open risks: missing SYSTEM_STATUS.json and absent KI profile leave integration constraints/known bugs unchecked; executor should re-confirm profile guardrails and consider whether “accuracy” is the right target metric for TE significance.
