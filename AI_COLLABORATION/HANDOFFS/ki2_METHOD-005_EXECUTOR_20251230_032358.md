status: COMPLETE
task: METHOD-005
role: EXECUTOR
phase: EXECUTOR
files_changed: []
summary:
  - Module number_representations.py fully implemented (329 LOC)
  - All 16 unit tests pass (pytest verified in 1.71s)
  - 5 representation types: sum, mean, centroid, presence_vector, normalized_vector
  - GameTimeSeries dataclass supports cross-game normalization via pool_max
  - align_time_series() and get_train_test_split() ready for downstream analysis
  - Pure transformation module - no I/O, no side effects
  - No code changes needed - task was already COMPLETE per PROXY approval
  - Ready for TRANS-001..TRANS-004 downstream tasks

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): sum/mean/centroid/presence_vector/normalized_vector
- Rule 4 (target metric): time-series cross-game coupling analysis
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_number_representations.py -v` -> 16 passed (1.71s)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw
- Semantics: sum/mean/centroid/presence_vector/normalized_vector
- Target metric: enable Granger/DTW/MI/TE analysis for cross-lottery coupling

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_number_representations.py -v` -> 16 passed (1.71s)

# Umsetzung

Task verified COMPLETE. Module `kenobase/analysis/number_representations.py` (329 LOC) with 16/16 passing tests. No changes required.
