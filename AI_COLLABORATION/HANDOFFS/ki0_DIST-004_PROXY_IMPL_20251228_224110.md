phase: PROXY_IMPL
reviewed_handoff: ki2_DIST-004_EXECUTOR_20251228_223510.md
summary:
  - All 31 tests pass including 10 new birthday-correlation tests
  - Syntax check OK for popularity_correlation.py and analyze_popularity_proxy.py
  - New functions properly exported in __all__ list
  - BirthdayCorrelationResult dataclass correctly implements per-draw granularity
  - CLI script correctly handles NO_DATA case when GQ files unavailable
  - Rolling-window stability test implements Law A (stability threshold check)
  - No integration issues - module is self-contained analysis helper
  - Acceptance criteria evaluation logic is correct (r > 0.3, p < 0.05)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): birthday_score (0-1), winners (GQ sum), Spearman r
- Rule 4 (target metric): correlation r > 0.3, p < 0.05
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_popularity_correlation.py -v` -> 31 passed

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw
- Semantics: birthday_score (fraction 1-31), winners (GQ sum), Spearman correlation
- Target metric: r > 0.3 with p < 0.05

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_popularity_correlation.py -v` -> 31 passed
- `python scripts/analyze_popularity_proxy.py --help` -> OK

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

**APPROVED** - Implementation meets all acceptance criteria:

1. **MECHANISCH**: Syntax OK, 31/31 tests pass, imports work, CLI functional
2. **ARCHITEKTUR**: Follows PopularityResult pattern, rolling-window stability, Law A integration
3. **INTEGRATION**: Self-contained module, no cross-file dependencies, __all__ exports complete
4. **KNOWN BUGS**: None applicable to this task
