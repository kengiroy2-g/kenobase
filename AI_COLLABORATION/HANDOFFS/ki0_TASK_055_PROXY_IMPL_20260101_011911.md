status: APPROVED
task: TASK_055
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_IMPL
reviewed_handoff: "ki2_TASK_055_EXECUTOR_20260101_011710.md"
summary:
  - Executor ran 2-step workflow correctly: backtest (threshold 451) -> forensik
  - Backtest JSON: threshold=451, 2242 draws (2018-2024), 48 tickets tested
  - Total high-win events >450 EUR: 14 across 7 tickets (12 unique dates)
  - Forensik artifact validated: birthday_ratio=0.446, permutation p=0.558 (no clustering)
  - V1 vs V2 comparison included: V1=8 events, V2=6 events
  - Top performer: typ_6:pair_focused with 5 high-win events
  - No architecture violations, no integration issues

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-event
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): date, ticket_id, keno_type, numbers, hits, payout, strategy, birthday_ratio
- Rule 4 (target metric): forensik pattern analysis (birthday ratio, temporal clustering)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-event (each high-payout occurrence)
- Semantics: Events >450 EUR payout from backtest, enriched with draw context
- Target metric: Birthday ratio anomaly detection, temporal clustering significance

## Repro Commands
```powershell
python scripts/backtest_high_payout_tickets.py --draws "Keno_GPTs/Kenogpts_2/Basis_Tab/KENO_ab_2018.csv" --year 0 --threshold 451 --output results/high_payout_backtest_gt450.json
python scripts/analyze_high_win_forensik.py --backtest results/high_payout_backtest_gt450.json --draws "Keno_GPTs/Kenogpts_2/Basis_Tab/KENO_ab_2018.csv" --output results/high_win_forensik_gt450.json
```
-> results/high_win_forensik_gt450.json (verified, valid JSON)

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

## Verification Summary
| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| JSON valid | PASS |
| Event count consistent (14) | PASS |
| Threshold correct (451 = >450) | PASS |
| Scripts syntax OK | PASS |
| Data source correct (2018-2024) | PASS |

## Approval Justification
Implementation is complete and correct. All artifacts generated, validated, and documented with repro commands. No architecture violations or known bugs triggered.
