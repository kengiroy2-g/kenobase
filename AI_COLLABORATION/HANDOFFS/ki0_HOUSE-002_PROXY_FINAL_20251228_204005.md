status: COMPLETE
task: HOUSE-002
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - All 7 unit tests PASSED (TestAnalyzeHighStakePopularityBias)
  - HighStakePopularityResult dataclass verified (frozen=True, 9 fields)
  - analyze_high_stake_popularity_bias() function verified (lines 728-871)
  - Analysis script reproducible: 365 draws, r=0.024, p=0.64
  - Output JSON valid at results/house002_stake_popularity.json
  - Module exports complete in __all__ (line 874-889)
  - Hypothesis result: NOT SUPPORTED (no significant correlation)
  - No architecture decisions required - standalone hypothesis module

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): high_stake = 75th percentile (377,154 EUR); unpopular = below-median popularity
- Rule 4 (target metric): Spearman |r| > 0.15 with p < 0.05
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_house002.py` -> `results/house002_stake_popularity.json` VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw
- Semantics: high_stake_threshold = 75th percentile; unpopular_ratio = count(below-median popularity) / 20
- Target metric: Spearman correlation

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_house002.py` -> `results/house002_stake_popularity.json` VERIFIED
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_stake_correlation.py::TestAnalyzeHighStakePopularityBias -v` -> 7/7 PASSED

# Proxy Final Review

## Validator Coverage Assessment
Validator verified all critical aspects: unit tests (7/7 PASSED), dataclass immutability, function logic, script reproducibility, JSON output structure, and module exports.

## User Acceptance Assessment
Change acceptable: clean implementation following existing patterns, no breaking changes, clear hypothesis result, reproducible, proper test coverage.

## Architecture Questions
None. Standalone hypothesis analysis module reusing existing modules without global configuration changes.

## Final Decision
**APPROVED FOR COMPLETION**

HOUSE-002 task complete. Hypothesis "High-stake draws favor unpopular numbers" properly tested and falsified (NOT SUPPORTED, r=0.024, p=0.64).
