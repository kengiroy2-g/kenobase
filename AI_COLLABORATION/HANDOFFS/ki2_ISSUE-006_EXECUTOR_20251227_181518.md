status: COMPLETE
task: ISSUE-006
role: EXECUTOR
phase: EXECUTOR
files_changed:
  - kenobase/prediction/__init__.py
  - kenobase/prediction/synthesizer.py
  - kenobase/prediction/recommendation.py
  - scripts/predict.py
  - tests/unit/test_synthesizer.py
  - results/prediction_synthesis.json
summary:
  - Created kenobase/prediction/ module with HypothesisSynthesizer
  - Implemented synthesizer.py: loads HYP-007/010/011/012, computes per-number combined_score
  - Implemented recommendation.py: Tier A/B/C with decade filter + avalanche warning
  - Created scripts/predict.py CLI with --top, --max-per-decade, --output options
  - All 13 unit tests pass
  - Verified: 4 hypotheses loaded, 6 recommendations generated
  - Top: Zahl 36 (0.754 Tier A), Zahl 64 (0.718 Tier A)
  - Anti-Avalanche warning integrated (theta = 88% for 6 numbers)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-number
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): combined_score, tier, hypothesis_scores
- Rule 4 (target metric): prediction_accuracy
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/predict.py --top 6 --output results/prediction_synthesis.json`

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/predict.py --top 6 --output results/prediction_synthesis.json` -> results/prediction_synthesis.json
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_synthesizer.py -v` -> 13 passed
