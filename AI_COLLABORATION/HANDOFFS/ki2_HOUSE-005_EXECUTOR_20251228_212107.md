summary:
  - Fixed BOM encoding issue in near_miss_jackpot.py (utf-8-sig + lstrip BOM)
  - Generated missing HOUSE-004 result: results/house004_near_miss_jackpot.json
  - Created kenobase/analysis/house_edge_synthesis.py with dataclasses
  - Created scripts/analyze_house005.py synthesis script
  - Synthesis output: 4/4 hypotheses loaded, 1/4 supported (HOUSE-004)
  - Overall evidence score: 0.15 (NO_EVIDENCE verdict)
  - HOUSE-004 shows significant Near-Miss difference during jackpot periods (3/9 Keno-Typen)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): evidence_score (0.0-1.0), manipulation_verdict
- Rule 4 (target metric): manipulation_evidence_score
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_house005.py` -> `results/house005_synthesis_report.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (aggregates 4 hypothesis results)
- Semantics: evidence_score = weighted sum of hypothesis support indicators
- Target metric: manipulation_evidence_score (0.0-1.0)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_house004.py --gq-file "Keno_GPTs/Keno_GQ_2022_2023-2024.csv"` -> `results/house004_near_miss_jackpot.json`
- `python scripts/analyze_house005.py` -> `results/house005_synthesis_report.json`

# Umsetzung

Task HOUSE-005 completed. Created synthesis module and script that aggregates 4 house-edge hypothesis results into unified report. Overall evidence score 0.15 indicates NO_EVIDENCE of manipulation - data consistent with fair random draws.
