status: COMPLETE
task: DIST-005
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - APPROVED: All validator checks passed - syntax, execution, math, edge cases
  - Weighted average verified: (0.2559*0.30 + 0.96*0.25 + 0.7346*0.25) / 0.80 = 0.6255
  - DIST-004 NO_DATA graceful degradation working as designed
  - Verdict thresholds correct: STABLE (>=0.70), SUSPICIOUS (0.40-0.69), RANDOM (<0.40)
  - Pattern follows house_edge_synthesis.py architecture
  - JSON output schema valid, all required keys present
  - No BUG-001 triggers, no breaking changes
  - CLI works: python scripts/analyze_dist005.py -> results/dist005_synthesis.json

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (cross-hypothesis synthesis)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): evidence_score (0.0-1.0), verdict (STABLE/SUSPICIOUS/RANDOM)
- Rule 4 (target metric): overall distribution stability indicator
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/analyze_dist005.py -> results/dist005_synthesis.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (aggregates DIST-001/002/003/004 results)
- Semantics: evidence_score (0.0-1.0), verdict enum (STABLE/SUSPICIOUS/RANDOM)
- Target metric: Overall distribution stability indicator

## Repro Commands
- python scripts/analyze_dist005.py -> results/dist005_synthesis.json

# Proxy Final Review

**Decision: COMPLETE**

Validator covered all critical aspects. Implementation follows project patterns, handles NO_DATA gracefully, and produces correct mathematical results. No architecture questions or escalation needed.
