validated_handoff: "ki0_STRAT-002_PROXY_IMPL_20251230_062946.md"
summary:
  - All 3 files validated: number_arbitrage.py (513 lines), backtest script (306 lines), tests (274 lines)
  - Syntax verified: py_compile passes for all 3 files
  - 13/13 unit tests PASS (pytest -v completed in 4.99s)
  - Backtest JSON has all 7 required keys
  - Train/Test split correct: Train=2022-01-03 to 2023-12-31, Test=2024-01-01 to 2025-12-29
  - Scientific result: 0 rules discovered, 0 significant in test - edge does NOT persist (expected per Axiom A1)
  - Null model baseline: mean_max_lift=0.929, 95th_pctl=3.046 (50 permutations)
  - EuroJackpot negative control: 0 rules discovered, 0 significant (Axiom-First compliant)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-number-pair
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): ArbitrageRule dataclass with trigger_number/target_number/lag_days/lift/q_value
- Rule 4 (target metric): Out-of-Sample Lift > 1.1 AND p_value < 0.05
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/backtest_number_arbitrage.py` -> `results/number_arbitrage_backtest.json` VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-number-pair
- Semantics: ArbitrageRule with trigger_number/target_number/lag_days/lift/q_value
- Target metric: Out-of-Sample Lift > 1.1 AND p_value < 0.05

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/backtest_number_arbitrage.py` -> `results/number_arbitrage_backtest.json` VERIFIED
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_number_arbitrage.py -v` -> 13 passed (4.99s)
