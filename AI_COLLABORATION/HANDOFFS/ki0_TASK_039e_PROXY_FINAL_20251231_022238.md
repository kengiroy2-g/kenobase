status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_039e
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - Jackknife LOO script implemented and validated
  - Formula verified: SE = sqrt(((n-1)/n) * sum((theta_i - theta_bar)^2))
  - 95% CI calculation correct: mean +/- 1.96*SE
  - Combined result: Delta +4.27%, SE 4.69%, CI [-4.92%, 13.47%]
  - Statistical conclusion: V2 NOT significantly better than V1 at alpha=0.05
  - Robustness: CONSISTENT (all 3 types show positive V2-V1 delta)
  - All 6 Acceptance Criteria PASS
  - User would accept: delivers clear statistical answer to V1 vs V2 question

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-cycle (68 cycles x 3 KENO types = 204 samples)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): delta = V2_ROI - V1_ROI per cycle; LOO = leave-one-out
- Rule 4 (target metric): ROI-Delta variance, 95% CI, Signifikanz (alpha=0.05)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (standalone script, no integration)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/jackknife_v1_v2_loo.py` -> `results/jackknife_v1_v2_loo.json` VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-cycle (28-day non-overlapping, N=68 per type)
- Semantics: Jackknife LOO variance estimation on V2-V1 delta
- Target metric: Signifikanz der ROI-Differenz bei alpha=0.05

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/jackknife_v1_v2_loo.py` -> `results/jackknife_v1_v2_loo.json` VERIFIED

# Proxy Final Review

## Validator Check Review - APPROVED
VALIDATOR thoroughly verified:
1. Script runs successfully, reproduces exact JSON output
2. Jackknife SE formula manually verified (SE=9.0168 for typ_8 matches)
3. 95% CI formula correct (mean +/- 1.96*SE)
4. All 6 Acceptance Criteria PASS

## User Acceptance Decision - APPROVED
1. **Deliverable clarity**: JSON output has clear structure (per_type, combined, robustness_check)
2. **Statistical rigor**: Jackknife LOO appropriate for small sample size (N=68)
3. **Actionable conclusion**: Clear interpretation provided in output
4. **No breaking changes**: Standalone analysis script

## Architecture Questions - NONE OPEN
- No escalation needed
- Research finding, not decision point

## Final Decision: **COMPLETE**
