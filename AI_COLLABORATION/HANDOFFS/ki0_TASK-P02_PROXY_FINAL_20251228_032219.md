status: COMPLETE
task: TASK-P02
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - All 19 unit tests pass (verified via pytest: 19 passed, 36 warnings in 2.70s)
  - LightGBM Binary Classifier correctly implements per-number hit/miss prediction
  - Walk-Forward Validation (6mo train, 1mo test) matches TASK-P02 spec
  - 5-Fold Stratified CV implementation verified with stability tracking
  - Config ml section complete with all hyperparameters and acceptance criteria
  - Feature integration verified: 20 features match FeatureExtractor/KenoPredictor
  - Acceptance criteria (F1>=0.50, std<=0.05) wired in KenoTrainer lines 167-169, 277-288
  - All exports accessible from kenobase.prediction module

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-number (binary classification for numbers 1-70)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): 20 features -> LightGBM binary classification -> hit/miss prediction
- Rule 4 (target metric): F1 >= 0.50, Stability std <= 0.05
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_model.py -v` -> 19 passed, 36 warnings in 2.70s

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-number (binary classification 1-70 for KENO)
- Semantics: 20 features from FeatureExtractor -> LightGBM binary classifier -> hit (1) or miss (0)
- Target metric: F1-Score >= 0.50, Stability std <= 0.05 across Walk-Forward periods

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_model.py -v` -> 19 passed, 36 warnings in 2.70s

# Proxy Final Review

**VALIDATOR OUTPUT VERIFIED** - All 19 tests pass, syntax validation passed, imports verified, feature integration confirmed, config integration complete.

**INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION** - Re-ran pytest, confirmed 19/19 tests passed in 2.70s.

**USER ACCEPTANCE** - YES. Implementation follows TASK-P02 spec exactly.

**OPEN QUESTIONS** - None. All architecture decisions documented per spec.

**BREAKING CHANGES** - None. New module adds functionality without modifying existing code.

**DECISION: COMPLETE**
