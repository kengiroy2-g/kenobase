summary:
  - HOUSE-005 synthesizes results from HOUSE-001/002/003/004 into unified report
  - Dependency mapping: HOUSE-001=hyp015_jackpot_correlation.json (EXISTS)
  - HOUSE-002=house002_stake_popularity.json (EXISTS)
  - HOUSE-003=house003_rolling_stability.json (EXISTS)
  - HOUSE-004=house004_near_miss_jackpot.json (MISSING - run analyze_house004.py first)
  - Creates kenobase/analysis/house_edge_synthesis.py with dataclasses
  - Output: results/house005_synthesis_report.json
  - Overall evidence score 0.0-1.0 based on weighted hypothesis results

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): HouseEdgeSynthesisReport, evidence_score (0.0-1.0)
- Rule 4 (target metric): manipulation_evidence_score
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_house005.py` -> `results/house005_synthesis_report.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (aggregates 4 hypothesis results)
- Semantics: evidence_score = weighted sum of hypothesis support indicators
- Target metric: manipulation_evidence_score (0.0-1.0)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_house004.py` -> `results/house004_near_miss_jackpot.json` (PREREQUISITE)
- `python scripts/analyze_house005.py` -> `results/house005_synthesis_report.json`

**BLOCKER:** HOUSE-004 results file is missing. Must run `analyze_house004.py` before synthesis can proceed.

**Handoff:** `AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki1_HOUSE-005_ARCHITECT_20251228_211506.md`
