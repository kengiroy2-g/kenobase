status: COMPLETE
task: TASK-C02
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - Bug fix verified in kenobase/analysis/pattern.py:118-131 (parallel if statt elif)
  - All 16 unit tests PASSED (test_pattern.py)
  - Mathematical correctness: 4 matches = 11 patterns (C(4,2)+C(4,3)+C(4,4) = 6+4+1)
  - ISSUE-004 in backlog correctly marked DONE (line 399)
  - Pattern module is standalone - no integration points violated
  - No architectural decisions required - fix follows existing patterns
  - Code quality verified: type hints, comments, uses itertools.combinations
  - Ready for commit

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-pattern
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): match_count, duos[], trios[], quatros[], total_patterns
- Rule 4 (target metric): pattern extraction correctness
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_pattern.py -v` -> 16 passed

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-pattern
- Semantics: match_count -> generates all possible sub-patterns using combinations()
- Target metric: pattern extraction correctness (mathematically verified)

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_pattern.py -v` -> 16 passed (0.80s)

# Proxy Final Review

## 1. Validator Coverage Check
Validator checked all critical aspects: tests (16 passed), math correctness (11 patterns), syntax (py_compile), backlog update (line 399 DONE), code quality (type hints, combinations), and integration points (standalone).

## 2. User Acceptance Check
The fix addresses the original problem (elif ÔåÆ parallel if), no regressions (all tests pass), documentation updated (ISSUE-004 DONE), code follows project standards.

## 3. Architecture Questions
None - fix is self-contained within pattern.py, no breaking changes, uses standard Python itertools.

## 4. Eskalation Required?
**NO** - All criteria met, no open questions.

## Final Decision
**COMPLETE** - Task is done, ready for merge/commit.
