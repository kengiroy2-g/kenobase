status: APPROVED
task: METHOD-003
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_METHOD-003_ARCHITECT_20251230_025557.md"
summary:
  - METHOD-003 Mutual Information fully implemented at alternative_coupling.py:346-452
  - Histogram-based MI calculation with proper formula MI(X,Y) = sum p(x,y)*log2(p(x,y)/(p(x)*p(y)))
  - Permutation null model correctly implemented (line 429-432)
  - 3/3 unit tests verified passing (pytest run confirmed)
  - FDR correction available via apply_fdr_correction()
  - Exported in __all__ and integrated in run_all_methods()
  - No code changes needed - task is COMPLETE
  - Recommend marking METHOD-003 COMPLETE in ecosystem_analysis_plan.yaml

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (cross-lottery pair-wise coupling)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): MI in bits = sum p(x,y) * log2(p(x,y) / (p(x)*p(y)))
- Rule 4 (target metric): coupling detection (p-value <= alpha after permutation test)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_alternative_coupling.py::TestMutualInformationLagged -v` -> 3 passed

## Proxy Review

**APPROVED** - Implementation verified complete. All 3 tests pass. MI formula correct, null model properly implemented with permutation testing. Ready to mark METHOD-003 COMPLETE.
