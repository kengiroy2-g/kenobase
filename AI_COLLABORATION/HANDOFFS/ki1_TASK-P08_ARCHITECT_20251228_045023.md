summary:
  - EuroJackpot Model Transfer = Adapt KENO pipeline to work with EuroJackpot data
  - DataLoader already supports EuroJackpot (GameType.EUROJACKPOT) - bereinigt format verified
  - Config has games.eurojackpot section with correct thresholds (hot=0.13, cold=0.07)
  - PipelineRunner uses config.get_active_game() - already game-agnostic
  - EuroJackpot CSV exists: data/raw/eurojackpot/eurojackpot_archiv_bereinigt.csv
  - Required changes: config switch (active_game: eurojackpot) + validation test
  - Sum distribution expected_mean needs EuroJackpot formula: 5*(1+50)/2 = 127.5
  - Minimal code changes needed - architecture supports multi-game already

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-game
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): numbers_range=[1,50], numbers_to_draw=5, bonus_range=[1,12], bonus_count=2
- Rule 4 (target metric): validation (pipeline runs end-to-end with EuroJackpot data)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze.py --game eurojackpot` -> output/eurojackpot_analysis.json

**Handoff written to:** `AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki1_TASK-P08_ARCHITECT_20251228_045023.md`

**Key finding:** The architecture already supports EuroJackpot. Minimal changes needed:
1. Add `--game` CLI parameter to `scripts/analyze.py`
2. Make `sum_windows.expected_mean` game-aware (127.5 for EuroJackpot vs 710 for KENO)
3. Create integration test for validation
