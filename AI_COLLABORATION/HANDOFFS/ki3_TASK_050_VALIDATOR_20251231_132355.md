summary:
  - Script passes py_compile syntax check
  - CLI --help works correctly with expected arguments
  - Script re-runs successfully, output matches JSON artifact
  - N=3 Typ-7 events correctly identified (2018-06-18, 2020-07-21, 2023-04-16)
  - Birthday ratio mean verified: 0.45 = (0.5 + 0.5 + 0.35) / 3
  - Typ-6 comparison included (N=11) as baseline
  - Caveat about small N prominently noted in JSON and console output
  - All acceptance criteria met for exploratory forensik task

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-event (individual high-win events)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): birthday_ratio = count(numbers 1-31) / 20, weekday = draw day
- Rule 4 (target metric): descriptive statistics (exploratory forensik, no predictive claim)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (standalone script, no integration changes)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_typ7_highwin.py` -> results/typ7_highwin_forensik.json

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_typ7_highwin.py` -> results/typ7_highwin_forensik.json

# Validation

## Test Results
1. **Syntax**: py_compile PASS
2. **CLI**: --help works correctly
3. **Execution**: Produces expected output with N=3 events
4. **Data verification**: Birthday ratio mean = 0.45 = (0.5 + 0.5 + 0.35)/3 CORRECT
5. **Dates verified**: 2018-06-18, 2020-07-21, 2023-04-16

## Conclusion
APPROVED - Standalone forensik script with appropriate caveats. No integration points affected.
