status: COMPLETE
task: ECO-001
role: ARCHITECT
phase: ARCHITECT
files_changed: []
summary:
  - Task: Create Ecosystem-Graph with Games as Nodes and Robust Couplings as Edges
  - Input: results/cross_lottery_coupling.json (6 games, lags 0/1/2/7, FDR-corrected)
  - Input: alternative_coupling.py methods (Granger, MI, TE, DTW)
  - Output: kenobase/analysis/ecosystem_graph.py + results/ecosystem_graph.json
  - Graph data structure: NetworkX-compatible dict with nodes/edges/weights
  - Edge criterion: q_value < 0.05 AND lift > 1.1 OR significant alternative method
  - Visualization: Optional matplotlib/graphviz export
  - Tests: tests/unit/test_ecosystem_graph.py

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-game-pair
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): nodes=games, edges=robust couplings (q<0.05, lift>1.1)
- Rule 4 (target metric): FDR q-value + edge weight
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/build_ecosystem_graph.py` -> `results/ecosystem_graph.json`

## Key Deliverables for EXECUTOR
1. `kenobase/analysis/ecosystem_graph.py` - Core module with EcosystemNode, EcosystemEdge, EcosystemGraph dataclasses
2. `scripts/build_ecosystem_graph.py` - CLI script to generate graph from existing coupling results
3. `tests/unit/test_ecosystem_graph.py` - Unit tests for edge filtering and graph export
4. `results/ecosystem_graph.json` - Output artifact
