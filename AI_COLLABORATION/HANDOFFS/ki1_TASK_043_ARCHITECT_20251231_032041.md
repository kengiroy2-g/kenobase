summary:
  - "Task: Validate A3 axiom 'Ein Gewinn treibt alles' (small wins keep players engaged)"
  - "Evidence exists: SYSTEM_STATUS.json shows 72/74 to 74/74 winning_months across ticket types"
  - "Hypothesis: Any reasonable multi-number ticket wins at least once per month"
  - "Validation script: scripts/validate_win_frequency.py (to create)"
  - "Null model: Random ticket baseline vs structured tickets"
  - "Metric: Percentage of months with >=1 win per ticket type"
  - "Acceptance: >95% of months have wins = A3 confirmed"
  - "Data source: data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv (N~1457 draws)"

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (per-ticket-type)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): winning_months = count of months where ticket matches >=2 numbers
- Rule 4 (target metric): win_frequency_per_month (>=1 win per month threshold)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/validate_win_frequency.py -> results/win_frequency_validation.json or UNVERIFIED (script not yet created)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (per-ticket-type: Typ-2 to Typ-10)
- Semantics: A month counts as "winning" if the fixed ticket achieves GK >= lowest tier at least once
- Target metric: win_frequency = months_with_win / total_months (target: >95%)

## Repro Commands
- python scripts/validate_win_frequency.py -> results/win_frequency_validation.json (UNVERIFIED - to be created)
