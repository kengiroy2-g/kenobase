status: APPROVED
task: ISSUE-006
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_IMPL
reviewed_handoff: "ki2_ISSUE-006_EXECUTOR_20251227_181518.md"
summary:
  - All 13 unit tests pass (pytest tests/unit/test_synthesizer.py -v)
  - Python syntax validated for all 3 modules (py_compile)
  - Prediction script generates valid JSON output (results/prediction_synthesis.json)
  - 4 hypotheses loaded: HYP-007, HYP-010, HYP-011, HYP-012
  - 6 recommendations generated with correct Tier A/B classification
  - Zehnergruppen-Filter correctly applied (max 2 per decade)
  - Anti-Avalanche warning integrated (theta = 88% for 6 numbers)
  - Architecture consistent: per-number granularity, 0-1 normalized scores
---

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-number (70 KENO numbers)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): combined_score, tier, hypothesis_scores
- Rule 4 (target metric): prediction_accuracy
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/predict.py --top 6 --output results/prediction_synthesis.json` -> results/prediction_synthesis.json

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_synthesizer.py -v` -> 13 passed
- `python scripts/predict.py --top 6 --output results/prediction_synthesis.json` -> Valid JSON

# Proxy Review (Implementation)
