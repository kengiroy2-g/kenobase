# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw (aggregated to number-level)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): EXPECTED_ODDS[(keno_type, matches)] -> quote; z-score < -1.5 -> LOW_POPULARITY
- Rule 4 (target metric): unpopularity_ratio
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): pytest tests/unit/test_payout_inference.py -v -> 16 passed

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw (aggregated to number-level in NumberUnpopularityResult)
- Semantics: EXPECTED_ODDS[(keno_type, matches)] -> fixed quote
- Target metric: unpopularity_ratio (low_popularity_count / total_count per number)

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_payout_inference.py -v` -> 16 passed in 0.88s
- `python scripts/analyze_payout_inference.py --data Keno_GPTs/KENO_Quote_details_2023.csv --draws data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2018.csv` -> results/payout_inference.json
