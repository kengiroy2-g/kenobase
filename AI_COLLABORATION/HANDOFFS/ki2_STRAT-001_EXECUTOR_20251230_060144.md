The task is complete. Let me provide the final handoff output:

status: COMPLETE
task: STRAT-001
role: EXECUTOR
phase: EXECUTOR
files_changed:
  - kenobase/analysis/cross_game_timing.py
  - scripts/analyze_cross_game_timing.py
  - tests/unit/test_cross_game_timing.py
  - results/cross_game_timing.json
summary:
  - Created cross_game_timing.py module (320 lines) with DrawSchedule, timing signals, permutation test
  - Created analyze_cross_game_timing.py CLI script for running analysis
  - Created test_cross_game_timing.py with 15 passing unit tests
  - Ran analysis on 1457 KENO draws with schedule-preserving permutation null model
  - Result: 0 significant signals found - draw-day timing alone insufficient
  - Key insight: Weekly pattern confounds timing signals (null_std=0 in permutation test)
  - Architecture supports extension to outcome-based timing (beyond schedule-only)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-game-pair (KENO vs LOTTO/AW/EW)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): timing_signal, lag_days, draw_schedules, hit_rate, ev_multiplier
- Rule 4 (target metric): hit_rate_improvement_pct
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_cross_game_timing.py -k data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv -o results/cross_game_timing.json` -> results/cross_game_timing.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-game-pair
- Semantics: is_lotto_draw_day, is_auswahlwette_draw_day, days_since_X, post_X_lag7
- Target metric: hit_rate_improvement_pct

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_cross_game_timing.py -k data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv -o results/cross_game_timing.json`
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_cross_game_timing.py -v` (15 passed)

# Implementation

## Files Created

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| kenobase/analysis/cross_game_timing.py | 320 | Core timing analysis module |
| scripts/analyze_cross_game_timing.py | 160 | CLI script |
| tests/unit/test_cross_game_timing.py | 316 | 15 unit tests |
| results/cross_game_timing.json | 71 | Analysis output |

## Analysis Results (1457 KENO draws)

| Signal | Favorable Days | Hit Rate | Improvement | Significant |
|--------|----------------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| is_lotto_draw_day | 416 | 56.0% | +1.2% | No |
| is_auswahlwette_draw_day | 208 | 51.4% | -7.0% | No |

## Key Finding

Schedule-only timing signals are confounded with weekly patterns (permutation null_std=0). The robust edge from ecosystem graph (KENO->AW lag=7, lift=2.41) requires **outcome-based** coupling analysis, not just draw-day timing. Architecture is ready for this extension.
