status: APPROVED
task: TASK_052
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_TASK_052_ARCHITECT_20251231_134956.md"
summary:
  - VERIFIED: high_win_forensik.json contains 0 Typ-9 events (only Typ-6: 11, Typ-7: 3)
  - ARCHITECT approach is correct: Null-Result-Forensik documenting theoretical expectations vs reality
  - Script pattern (analyze_typ7_highwin.py) verified as template - lines 44-59 show keno_type filter pattern
  - Task scope appropriately redefined to document ABSENCE + theoretical analysis
  - Probability calc P(8/9)=9.94e-05 is correct combinatorially
  - No data fabrication - script will compute from backtest data directly
  - Output path results/typ9_highwin_forensik.json follows existing convention
  - Acceptance Criteria is measurable: output file + theoretical bounds documented

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-ticket-type
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): keno_type=9, high_payout_threshold=400 EUR, 8/9=1000 EUR, 9/9=50000 EUR
- Rule 4 (target metric): event_count (observed=0), theoretical_p_high, expected_wait_draws
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (standalone script, no core module changes)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/analyze_typ9_highwin.py -> results/typ9_highwin_forensik.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-ticket-type (Typ-9 vs Typ-6/Typ-7 baseline)
- Semantics: high_payout_threshold=400 EUR, 8/9 hits=1000 EUR, 9/9 hits=50000 EUR
- Target metric: event_count (observed=0), theoretical probability, expected wait time

## Repro Commands
- python scripts/analyze_typ9_highwin.py -> results/typ9_highwin_forensik.json

# Proxy Review

## 1. MECHANISCH ✓
- Plan is complete with clear deliverables
- Acceptance Criteria is measurable: output file exists with documented theoretical bounds
- Script follows established pattern (analyze_typ7_highwin.py template)

## 2. ARCHITEKTUR ✓
- No ADR violations
- Null-Result-Forensik is aligned with Axiom-First approach (documenting WHY vs fishing for patterns)
- Output format consistent with existing forensik files

## 3. INTEGRATION ✓
- No cross-file dependencies beyond read-only access to existing JSON files
- Template script (analyze_typ7_highwin.py) verified at lines 49-52 for keno_type filter pattern
- Output path follows convention: results/typ9_highwin_forensik.json

## 4. KONZEPTIONELL ✓
- ARCHITECT correctly identified that filtering from forensik.json yields 0 results
- Appropriate scope change: theoretical analysis documenting absence vs event forensics
- Comparison with Typ-6/Typ-7 as baseline adds value
- Expected wait time calculation (10,000+ draws) provides useful context

## Known Bugs Check
- BUG-001 (global thresholds): NOT APPLICABLE - per-ticket-type analysis
- BUG-003 (Orchestrator integration): NOT APPLICABLE - standalone analysis script

## Conclusion
Plan is sound. The ARCHITECT correctly pivoted from "filter existing events" to "document theoretical expectations vs observed absence" which is the scientifically appropriate approach for rare events with N=0.
