status: APPROVED
task: TASK_022
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_IMPL
reviewed_handoff: "ki2_TASK_022_EXECUTOR_20251230_194837.md"
summary:
  - SYSTEM_STATUS.json (stand 2025-12-29 v2.2.2) read; KI0 proxy profile file missing/not found.
  - Repro check: `python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py > AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/v4_runtime/TASK_022_overlap.log` regenerates `results/overlap_statistics.json` (py_compile sanity pass ok).
  - Data: `results/overlap_statistics.json` (n=1457 draws from data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv) shows mean overlap 5.745 vs expected 5.714, z=0.688, p=0.492; Bonferroni corrected alpha 0.00333, no significant findings.
  - Phase splits PRE/POST/COOLDOWN/NORMAL overlaps 5.67-5.84 and birthday ratios 0.435-0.462 all non-significant; matches executor report and target calibration framing.
  - Handoff recorded at `AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki0_TASK_022_PROXY_IMPL_20251230_195337.md`; CURRENT_STATUS not modified.

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED (SYSTEM_STATUS.json read; ki0_proxy.md missing; git status captured)
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global + per-phase (PRE_JACKPOT/POST_JACKPOT/COOLDOWN/NORMAL)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): overlap_count per draw and birthday_ratio vs expected baselines
- Rule 4 (target metric): calibration
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py > AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/v4_runtime/TASK_022_overlap.log -> results/overlap_statistics.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global + per-phase (PRE_JACKPOT/POST_JACKPOT/COOLDOWN/NORMAL)
- Semantics: overlap_count with previous draw and birthday_ratio per draw compared to expected means
- Target metric: calibration vs expected overlap 5.714 and birthday_ratio 0.4429 with Bonferroni guard

## Repro Commands
- python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py > AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/v4_runtime/TASK_022_overlap.log -> results/overlap_statistics.json

# Proxy Review (Implementation)
- Execution reproducible and outputs match executor summary; no mechanical or architectural inconsistencies detected in results/overlap_statistics.json.
- No significant deviations after Bonferroni; per-phase and global metrics align with plan expectations.
- KI0 proxy profile spec absent; flagged in handoff for validator awareness.
