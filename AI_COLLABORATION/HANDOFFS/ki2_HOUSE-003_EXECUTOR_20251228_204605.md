# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (daily rolling windows)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): CV = std/mean of restbetrag over 7/14/30 day windows
- Rule 4 (target metric): stability (CV < 0.15 indicates active payout control)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_house003.py` -> results/house003_rolling_stability.json

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_house003.py` -> results/house003_rolling_stability.json
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_house_edge_stability.py -v` -> 14/14 passed
