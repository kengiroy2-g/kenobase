role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_TASK_022_ARCHITECT_20251230_194327.md"
summary:
  - Plan covers inputs → status/profile housekeeping → repro → metric validation → docs/logs; sequencing is coherent.
  - Metrics framed as calibration vs E[Overlap]=5.714 with Bonferroni guard; per-phase diagnostics keep granularity acceptable (no BUG-001/003 triggers seen).
  - SYSTEM_STATUS.json fehlt; plan step to mirror from SYSTEM_STATUS.md is appropriate.
  - KI0 proxy profile spec still missing; executor must flag/request source while proceeding.
  - Repro/log/output paths are explicit (analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py -> TASK_022_overlap.log, results/overlap_statistics.json; includes cycles_comprehensive_analysis.json regeneration).

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): UNVERIFIED (SYSTEM_STATUS.json missing; CLAUDE.md read; git status run)
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): overlap_count, overlap_birthday_ratio (overlap>0), phases PRE_JACKPOT/POST_JACKPOT/COOLDOWN/NORMAL
- Rule 4 (target metric): calibration
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py > AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/v4_runtime/TASK_022_overlap.log -> results/overlap_statistics.json (UNVERIFIED)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (phase-specific diagnostics)
- Semantics: previous-day overlap count per draw; birthday_ratio = share of {1..31} in overlap; phases as above
- Target metric: calibration (obs vs expected overlaps/birthday ratios with multiple-testing guard)

## Repro Commands
- python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py > AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/v4_runtime/TASK_022_overlap.log -> results/overlap_statistics.json (UNVERIFIED)

# Proxy Review
- Plan is conceptually sound and aligned with CLAUDE/ADR guardrails; no red-flag thresholds or missing orchestrator hooks detected.
- Only dependencies are the absent SYSTEM_STATUS.json (plan to rebuild) and missing KI0 proxy profile spec (must be requested/flagged during execution).
- Handoff created: `AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki0_TASK_022_PROXY_PLAN_20251230_194637.md` (status APPROVED).
