status: APPROVED
task: HYP-004
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_IMPL
reviewed_handoff: "ki2_HYP-004_EXECUTOR_20251227_144808.md"
summary:
  - Implementation is correct and complete
  - 21 unit tests all passing
  - Syntax check OK (py_compile passes)
  - JSON result file valid and well-structured
  - __init__.py exports properly updated (12 new symbols)
  - analyze_hyp004.py script functions correctly
  - Acceptance Criteria evaluated: r=0.0497, p=0.683 -> HYP-004 NOT SUPPORTED
  - Only 2% of rolling windows (45/2208) show supporting evidence

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (per-number across all draws)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): popularity=GQ winner counts weighted by Keno-Typ, frequency=draw appearances
- Rule 4 (target metric): Spearman correlation r < -0.2 with p < 0.05
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (module is standalone analysis helper)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_hyp004.py` -> data/results/hyp004_correlation.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (all 70 KENO numbers)
- Semantics: popularity from GQ winners, frequency from draws
- Target metric: Spearman r < -0.2 AND p < 0.05

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_hyp004.py` -> data/results/hyp004_correlation.json
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_popularity_correlation.py -v` -> 21 passed

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

## Verification Results

| Dimension | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| MECHANISCH | PASS - All files created, syntax OK, 21 tests passing |
| ARCHITEKTUR | PASS - Follows hypothesis spec, Spearman correlation, walk-forward |
| INTEGRATION | PASS - __init__.py exports correct, no orphaned imports |
| KNOWN BUGS | N/A - Standalone module, no threshold or orchestrator issues |

## Conclusion

**APPROVED** - Implementation is scientifically rigorous and architecturally sound.

**Key Finding:** HYP-004 is NOT SUPPORTED (r=0.05, p=0.68). No evidence that RNG avoids popular numbers.
