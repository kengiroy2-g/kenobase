reviewed_handoff: "ki2_TASK_053_EXECUTOR_20251231_140957.md"
summary:
  - Script scripts/analyze_typ10_highwin.py (407 lines) created and syntax-validated
  - Probability calculations mathematically verified: P(9/10)=2.12e-05, P(10/10)=4.66e-07
  - Output results/typ10_highwin_forensik.json is valid JSON (63 lines)
  - Poisson null-hypothesis correctly computed: P(0|9/10)=95.4%, P(0|10/10)=99.9%
  - Baseline comparison to Typ-6,7,8,9 included with consistent methodology
  - Uses kenobase/core/keno_quotes.py as single source of truth (9/10=1000, 10/10=100000 EUR)
  - No integration issues - standalone forensik script pattern matches existing analyze_typ9_highwin.py
  - All acceptance criteria met

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (all historical draws)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): high-win = 9/10 OR 10/10 hits; payouts per keno_quotes.py
- Rule 4 (target metric): Poisson p-value (null-hypothesis consistency)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (standalone forensik script)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_typ10_highwin.py` -> `results/typ10_highwin_forensik.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (all historical draws 2018-2025)
- Semantics: Typ-10 high-win = 9/10 (1000 EUR) OR 10/10 (100000 EUR) hits
- Target metric: Poisson p-value for observing 0 events given expected count

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_typ10_highwin.py` -> `results/typ10_highwin_forensik.json`

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

## Review Summary

**APPROVED** - Implementation is mathematically correct, architecturally sound, and meets all acceptance criteria.

### Key Verifications:
1. **Syntax**: Python compiles without errors
2. **JSON Output**: Valid and well-structured
3. **Math**: Combinatorial probabilities verified independently
4. **Pattern**: Follows established forensik script conventions

### Minor Note:
Docstring header contains outdated probability estimates (from earlier planning phase) that differ from the actual computed values. The **code calculations are correct** - only the docstring comments are stale. This is cosmetic and does not affect functionality.
