summary:
  - All 26 tests pass (pytest -> 26 passed in 1.71s)
  - Formula (Max-Min)/Max verified manually with edge cases
  - Syntax validated via py_compile for spread_index.py
  - __init__.py exports 6 symbols correctly at lines 319-324 and 613-618
  - Import test from kenobase.analysis successful
  - Frozen dataclasses, chi-square, guardrail pattern matches parity_ratio.py
  - Edge cases handled: empty list, single number, same numbers, max=0
  - Code quality high with type hints and Google-style docstrings

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): SpreadIndex = (Max-Min)/Max, range [0,1]
- Rule 4 (target metric): chi-square test for uniform distribution
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_spread_index.py -v` -> 26 passed

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw
- Semantics: SpreadIndex = (Max-Min)/Max, normalized [0,1]
- Target metric: chi-square test for uniform distribution validation

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_spread_index.py -v` -> 26 passed in 1.71s
- `python -m py_compile kenobase/analysis/spread_index.py` -> SYNTAX OK

# Validation

**APPROVED** - All 26 tests pass, formula verified, exports correct, pattern followed.
