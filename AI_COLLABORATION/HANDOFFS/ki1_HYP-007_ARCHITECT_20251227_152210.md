status: COMPLETE
task: HYP-007
role: ARCHITECT
phase: ARCHITECT
files_changed: []
summary:
  - HYP-007 validates Duo/Trio/Quatro pattern hypothesis from HYPOTHESES_CATALOG.md:164-183
  - pattern.py already implements bug-fixed extraction (parallel if vs. elif)
  - Unit tests exist with 100% coverage of extraction logic
  - Validation script needed to test predictive power on real data
  - Data available: data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2018.csv
  - Metrics: pattern frequency, cycle duration, prediction accuracy
  - Acceptance: Pattern prediction > random baseline (5% significance)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-pattern
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): Duo/Trio/Quatro tuples
- Rule 4 (target metric): prediction accuracy vs. baseline
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): pytest tests/unit/test_pattern.py -v
