status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_003
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - All 33 unit tests pass (pytest tests/unit/test_cycle_phases.py -v in 1.70s)
  - Module kenobase/analysis/cycle_phases.py syntax verified (py_compile OK)
  - Phase boundaries correct: COOLDOWN=0-30d, GROWTH=31-60d, HOT=>60d, UNKNOWN=vor Jackpot
  - Exports in __init__.py verified: Phase, PhaseLabel at lines 631-632, functions at 637-639
  - TYPE_CHECKING import for DrawResult avoids circular import
  - PhaseLabel frozen dataclass (immutable) verified
  - REUSE of jackpot_correlation.py functions (no duplication)
  - No BUG-001/BUG-003 violations (module-scoped constants)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): Phase enum (COOLDOWN|GROWTH|HOT|UNKNOWN), PhaseLabel frozen dataclass
- Rule 4 (target metric): phase-coverage (100% draws labeled) + Unit-Test pass rate (33/33)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (module-scoped constants COOLDOWN_MAX_DAYS=30, GROWTH_MAX_DAYS=60)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_cycle_phases.py -v` -> 33 passed in 1.70s

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw
- Semantics: Phase.COOLDOWN (0-30d), Phase.GROWTH (31-60d), Phase.HOT (>60d), Phase.UNKNOWN (vor Jackpot)
- Target metric: phase-coverage + Unit-Test pass rate (33/33 = 100%)

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_cycle_phases.py -v` -> 33 passed in 1.70s

# Proxy Final Review

**Decision: COMPLETE**

Validator covered all critical aspects. Implementation follows established patterns, uses proper code reuse from jackpot_correlation.py, and passes all 33 tests. No breaking changes, no open architecture questions, no user decisions needed.

**Handoff:** `AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki0_TASK_003_PROXY_FINAL_20251230_142150.md`
