validated_handoff: "ki0_VALID-001_PROXY_IMPL_20251230_060753.md"
summary:
  - All 6 tests pass (pytest 2.65s verified)
  - CrossGameRule dataclass frozen=True confirmed at line 33 in cross_game_rule_backtester.py
  - Test file has no mypy errors (errors shown are in other files)
  - Frozen-rules invariant validated: backtest receives rules externally, no mining
  - Data leakage prevention verified (train dates <= train_end)
  - Rule immutability enforced via FrozenInstanceError
  - Code quality acceptable (no linting issues in test file)
  - Implementation aligns with CLAUDE.md Section 3.0 Axiom-First approach

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): CrossGameRule frozen on Train, passed to backtest without re-mining
- Rule 4 (target metric): Out-of-Sample rule accuracy lift
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_frozen_rules_invariant.py -v` -> 6 passed VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global
- Semantics: Frozen rules pattern - rules mined on Train are immutable when applied to Test
- Target metric: Test validation (all 6 tests pass)

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_frozen_rules_invariant.py -v` -> 6 passed in 2.65s VERIFIED

# Validation

## Test Results
```
6 passed in 2.65s
```

## Code Quality Check
- mypy: No errors in test file
- CrossGameRule frozen=True verified at kenobase/prediction/cross_game_rule_backtester.py:33

## Acceptance Criteria Verification
| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| frozen-rules invariant | PASS |
| Data leakage prevention | PASS |
| Immutability | PASS |
| No mining in backtest | PASS |
| Consistent rule application | PASS |

## Final Status
**APPROVED** - Implementation correctly validates the Train->Test frozen rules invariant.
