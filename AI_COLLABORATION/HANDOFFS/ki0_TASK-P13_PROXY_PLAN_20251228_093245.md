**PROXY Review Complete**

```
status: REJECTED
task: TASK-P13
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
```

**Summary:**
- ARCHITECT handoff is **truncated** (only 66 lines, ends mid-table)
- Missing: code skeletons, config YAML block, dataclass definitions, test scenarios
- This is the **3rd iteration** with the same truncation issue
- Integration point verified: `kenobase/prediction/recommendation.py` exists with `Recommendation` dataclass
- Config `default.yaml` has no `bot:` section yet

**Handoff created:**
`AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki0_TASK-P13_PROXY_PLAN_20251228_093245.md`

**Next step:** Return to ARCHITECT to provide COMPLETE handoff with all required sections (code templates, config schema, test scenarios, implementation phases).
