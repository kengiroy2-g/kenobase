summary:
  - Formula Line 34 is CORRECT: P(k|n) = C(n,k)*C(70-n,20-k)/C(70,20)
  - All probability/ROI tables for Types 2-9 contain miscalculated values
  - 8/9 KENO types exceed 1pp tolerance (only Typ 10 passes)
  - Error range: +1.05pp (Typ 2) to +23.91pp (Typ 7)
  - Document shows implausible ROI 21%-56% (correct: 43%-51%)
  - AC2 (Probabilities) FAIL, AC4 (ROI) FAIL
  - Full artifact: AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/keno_roi_validation_20251228.md
  - Return to EXECUTOR for complete recalculation

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED (SYSTEM_STATUS.json not found, git status checked)
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-KENO-type
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): ROI = sum(P(k) * Quote(k)) for all winning k values
- Rule 4 (target metric): ROI accuracy within 1pp tolerance
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -c "from math import comb; ..."` -> stdout verified

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-KENO-type (Types 2-10)
- Semantics: ROI = Expected Value / Stake = sum(hypergeometric_prob(k) * payout(k))
- Target metric: ROI within 1 percentage point of correct value

## Repro Commands
- Python hypergeometric calculation -> stdout (see handoff)
- Artifact: AI_COLLABORATION/ARTIFACTS/keno_roi_validation_20251228.md

# Validation

## Test Results

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Formula verification (Line 34) | PASS - Formula is correct |
| Type 10 probabilities | PASS - All match official odds |
| Type 10 ROI | PASS - 49.40% (doc: 49.66%, diff: -0.26pp) |
| Types 2-9 probabilities | FAIL - Systematically miscalculated |
| Types 2-9 ROI | FAIL - 8/9 exceed 1pp tolerance |

## Acceptance Criteria

| AC | Status |
|----|--------|
| AC1: All 9 types documented | PASS |
| AC2: Probabilities correct | **FAIL** |
| AC3: Quotes match lotto.de | PASS |
| AC4: ROI within 1pp | **FAIL** |

## Decision

**REJECTED** - Document requires complete recalculation of probability and ROI tables for Types 2-9 before approval.
