status: COMPLETE
task: TASK-C03
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - All 10 unit tests pass (pytest tests/unit/test_gk1_loader.py -v -> 10 passed in 0.40s)
  - GK1Summary model loads 20 records from 10-9_KGDaten_gefiltert.csv
  - GK1Hit model loads 4 records from 10-9_Liste_GK1_Treffer.csv
  - Format auto-detection correctly differentiates GK1_SUMMARY vs GK1_HIT via Date_Check header
  - Pydantic validation enforces keno_typ in {9,10}, numbers count=6, range [1,70]
  - __all__ export includes GK1Summary, GK1Hit (data_loader.py:935-942)
  - MINOR: GK1Summary/GK1Hit not re-exported in kenobase/core/__init__.py (deferred)
  - Implementation complete and approved for merge

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED (SYSTEM_STATUS.json missing, git status verified)
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-event
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): GK1Summary(keno_typ,datum,anzahl_ziehungen,treffer), GK1Hit(7 fields incl z1-z6)
- Rule 4 (target metric): N/A (data integration)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_gk1_loader.py -v` -> 10 passed in 0.40s

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-event
- Semantics: GK1Summary for aggregated keno events, GK1Hit for events with 6-number combo
- Target metric: N/A

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_gk1_loader.py -v` -> 10 passed in 0.40s

# Proxy Final Review

## Final Decision

**COMPLETE** - Task TASK-C03 approved for closure.

- Validator verified all critical aspects
- User would accept: clean patterns, tests pass, data loads correctly
- No architecture decisions pending
- Minor re-export gap documented for future cleanup (non-blocking)
