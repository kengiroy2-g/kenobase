# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-year
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): {year: int, number: int, absolute_frequency: int, relative_frequency: float, total_draws: int}
- Rule 4 (target metric): frequency distribution stability over time (Axiom A5)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_frequency_per_year.py` -> results/frequency_per_year.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-year
- Semantics: YearlyFrequencyResult dataclass
- Target metric: year-over-year frequency consistency (Axiom A5 validation)

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_frequency_per_year.py -v` -> 11/11 passed
- `python scripts/analyze_frequency_per_year.py` -> results/frequency_per_year.json
