status: COMPLETE
task: VALID-001
role: ARCHITECT
phase: ARCHITECT
files_changed: []
summary:
  - Analyzed Train->Test validation infrastructure for cross-lottery couplings
  - Current backtest shows 0 rules mined with alpha=0.05 (no significant couplings in Train)
  - Existing script scripts/backtest_cross_game_rule_layer_train_test.py implements correct split logic
  - Frozen rules pattern: rules mined on Train (2022-2023) are frozen and applied to Test (2024+)
  - Validation gap identified: need dedicated test asserting frozen rules are NOT re-fitted on Test
  - Existing unit tests cover conditional_lifts_* but not Train->Test separation invariants
  - Need to validate that exclusion/inclusion rules from Train show Out-of-Sample signal (or null)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED (git status read, no SYSTEM_STATUS.json found)
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (cross-lottery coupling rules)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): ConditionalLift q_value <= alpha_fdr as selection criterion
- Rule 4 (target metric): Out-of-Sample rule accuracy (exclusion/inclusion lift vs baseline)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/backtest_cross_game_rule_layer_train_test.py` -> `results/cross_game_rule_layer_train_test_backtest.json`

## Task Setup
- **Granularity:** global (all cross-lottery rules evaluated together)
- **Semantics:** CrossGameRule with source, target, lag_days, trigger, q_value; frozen = mined on Train only
- **Target metric:** Out-of-Sample accuracy lift (exclusion: accuracy - 0.7143, inclusion: accuracy - 0.2857)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/backtest_cross_game_rule_layer_train_test.py --train-end 2023-12-31` -> `results/cross_game_rule_layer_train_test_backtest.json`
- Current result: rules_mined=0 (no q<=0.05 rules found in Train period)
