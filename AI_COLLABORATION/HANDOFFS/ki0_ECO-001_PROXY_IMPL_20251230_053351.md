status: APPROVED
task: ECO-001
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_IMPL
reviewed_handoff: "ki6_ECO-001_EXECUTOR_20251230_052951.md"
summary:
  - Implementation is mechanically correct: all files created, syntax valid, 16/16 tests pass
  - Edge criterion correctly implemented: q_value < 0.05 AND lift > 1.1
  - EuroJackpot correctly marked as control node (is_control=True)
  - NetworkX-compatible output format verified in results/ecosystem_graph.json
  - Graph has 6 nodes, 1 significant edge (KENO->AUSWAHLWETTE, lag=7d, lift=2.41, q=0.0265)
  - CLI script works with --help and repro command verified
  - MINOR: ecosystem_graph not exported in kenobase/analysis/__init__.py (acceptable - standalone module)
  - No Known Bugs reproduced (BUG-001 to BUG-010 patterns not matched)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-game-pair
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): nodes=games, edges=robust couplings (q<0.05, lift>1.1)
- Rule 4 (target metric): FDR q-value + edge weight (lift)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/build_ecosystem_graph.py` -> `results/ecosystem_graph.json` VERIFIED

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/build_ecosystem_graph.py` -> `results/ecosystem_graph.json` VERIFIED
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_ecosystem_graph.py -v` -> 16 passed VERIFIED

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

## Summary

**APPROVED** - The ECO-001 implementation is correct and complete.

### Verification Results
| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Syntax (py_compile) | PASS |
| Tests (16/16) | PASS |
| JSON valid | PASS |
| CLI --help | PASS |
| Edge criterion | Correctly implemented |
| EuroJackpot control | Correctly marked |
| NetworkX format | Compatible |

### Output Artifact
`results/ecosystem_graph.json`:
- 6 nodes (all German lottery games)
- 1 significant edge: KENO→AUSWAHLWETTE (lag=7d, lift=2.41, q=0.0265)
- EUROJACKPOT marked as external control

### Minor Observation (Non-Blocking)
Module not exported in `kenobase/analysis/__init__.py` - acceptable as standalone analysis module with direct import.
