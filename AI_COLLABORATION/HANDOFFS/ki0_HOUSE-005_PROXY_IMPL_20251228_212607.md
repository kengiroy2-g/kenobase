reviewed_handoff: "ki2_HOUSE-005_EXECUTOR_20251228_212107.md"
summary:
  - Syntax validation PASSED: house_edge_synthesis.py, analyze_house005.py
  - JSON validation PASSED: house005_synthesis_report.json
  - Module import verified: run_synthesis, SynthesisReport, HypothesisResult
  - Script reproducibility verified: runs successfully
  - 4/4 hypothesis files loaded, 1/4 supported (HOUSE-004)
  - Overall evidence score: 0.15 -> NO_EVIDENCE verdict correct
  - Dataclasses architecture aligns with Kenobase patterns

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): evidence_score (0.0-1.0), manipulation_verdict
- Rule 4 (target metric): manipulation_evidence_score
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_house005.py` -> `results/house005_synthesis_report.json` VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (aggregates 4 hypothesis results)
- Semantics: evidence_score = weighted sum of hypothesis support
- Target metric: manipulation_evidence_score (0.0-1.0)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_house005.py` -> `results/house005_synthesis_report.json` VERIFIED

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

**APPROVED** - Implementation is correct and complete:
- All claimed files created and valid
- Synthesis logic verified: 4 hypotheses loaded, weighted aggregation correct (0.15)
- Dataclass architecture is clean
- No Known Bugs triggered
- Reproducibility confirmed
