summary:
  - Plan is well-structured with clear 4-step implementation
  - Correctly leverages existing popularity_correlation.py pattern (484 lines, similar GQ handling)
  - Data sources identified: GQ (27,685 rows) + draws - overlap 2022-2024 properly noted
  - German number format handling documented (1.443 = 1443)
  - Pearson + Spearman dual correlation approach is sound
  - Safe/popular classification uses median +/- 1 std (reasonable threshold)
  - WORKING_SET_REQUEST includes all relevant reference files
  - Acceptance criteria are measurable and verifiable

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw + per-number aggregation
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): winner_count per Keno-Typ/date, drawn = 1 if number in draw
- Rule 4 (target metric): Pearson/Spearman correlation with p-value
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_hyp010.py --gq-file ... -> results/hyp010_odds_correlation.json`

## Proxy Review

**Verdict: APPROVED**

Plan follows established patterns from `popularity_correlation.py`. All 4 implementation steps are clear, acceptance criteria are measurable, and no Known Bugs (BUG-001 global thresholds, BUG-003 orchestrator integration) apply.
