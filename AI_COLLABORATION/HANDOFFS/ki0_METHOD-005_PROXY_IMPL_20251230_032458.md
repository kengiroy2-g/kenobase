summary:
  - Module number_representations.py verified complete (329 LOC)
  - All 16 unit tests pass (pytest verified in 1.66s)
  - 5 representation types: sum, mean, centroid, presence_vector, normalized_vector
  - GameTimeSeries dataclass with pool_max supports cross-game normalization
  - Correctly imports from kenobase.core.normalizer.GAME_RANGES
  - align_time_series() and get_train_test_split() ready for TRANS-001..004
  - Pure transformation module - no I/O, no side effects
  - No architecture violations, no known bugs reproduced

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): sum/mean/centroid/presence_vector/normalized_vector
- Rule 4 (target metric): enable Granger/DTW/MI/TE coupling analysis
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_number_representations.py -v` -> 16 passed (1.66s)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw
- Semantics: 5 representation types for time-series conversion
- Target metric: Enable downstream cross-lottery coupling analysis

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_number_representations.py -v` -> 16 passed (1.66s)

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

**APPROVED** - Task METHOD-005 complete. Module `kenobase/analysis/number_representations.py` (329 LOC) provides 5 representation types with 16 passing unit tests. Clean architecture, no integration issues, ready for TRANS-001..004 downstream tasks.
