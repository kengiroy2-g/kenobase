# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): WGZ = wiederkehrende Gewinnzahlen
- Rule 4 (target metric): pattern-predictability
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_recurrence.py -v` -> 26 passed (VERIFIED)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw
- Semantics: WGZ = recurring numbers between consecutive draws
- Target metric: pattern-predictability

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_recurrence.py -v` -> 26 passed (VERIFIED)
