summary:
  - confidence.py: Bootstrap CI implementation with ConfidenceInterval, ConfidenceEstimator, PredictionWithCI
  - ConfidenceEstimator uses 1000 bootstrap resamples (configurable), random_state=42 for reproducibility
  - CI width < 0.3 defines stable predictions (acceptance criterion met)
  - 95% CI is standard statistical practice (not a tunable global threshold - OK)
  - ensemble.py extended with ensemble_ci, ml_ci Optional fields on EnsemblePrediction
  - predict_with_ci() and get_stable_predictions() methods added to EnsemblePredictor
  - All 27 confidence tests pass, all 16 ensemble tests pass (43 total)
  - No integration issues detected - confidence module is self-contained with clean imports

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (95% CI is statistical standard, not game-specific)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): ci_lower, ci_upper, ci_width, is_stable, point_estimate, confidence_level
- Rule 4 (target metric): calibration (CI coverage near 95%)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_confidence.py -v` -> 27 passed in 1.20s

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global
- Semantics: ci_lower, ci_upper, ci_width, is_stable, point_estimate, confidence_level, n_bootstrap
- Target metric: calibration (CI coverage near 95%)

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_confidence.py -v` -> 27 passed in 1.20s
- `pytest tests/unit/test_ensemble.py -v` -> 16 passed in 1.12s
