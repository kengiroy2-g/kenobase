status: APPROVED
task: TASK_046
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_TASK_046_ARCHITECT_20251231_040443.md"
summary:
  - ARCHITECT correctly identified apparent contradiction (30.9% vs 0.0% delta_roi)
  - Verified: These are DIFFERENT methodologies, NOT contradictory claims
  - walk_forward_lookback_grid.json: Position rule layer (rules_roi == baseline_roi -> delta=0)
  - ticket_lifecycle_analysis.json: Frequency strategy (+30.9% avg_roi over 12 iterations)
  - Both artifacts exist and are readable (verified via Python extraction)
  - Plan steps 1-5 are well-structured with clear acceptance criteria
  - Repro commands verified: analyze_ticket_lifecycle.py exists, walk_forward_lookback_grid.py exists
  - Recommendation: Execute plan, document methodology differences as reconciliation

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-strategy (frequency, frequency_high, v2_style) + per-type (Typ-6 to Typ-10)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): ROI = ((won - invested) / invested) * 100%, delta_roi = rules_roi - baseline_roi
- Rule 4 (target metric): ROI improvement (delta_roi) with FDR-corrected significance
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/analyze_ticket_lifecycle.py -> results/ticket_lifecycle_analysis.json VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-strategy (frequency variants) + per-keno-type (Typ-6 to Typ-10)
- Semantics: delta_roi (position rules) vs avg_roi (frequency strategy) - DISTINCT metrics
- Target metric: Reconciliation of claims, not new delta_roi improvement

## Repro Commands
- python scripts/analyze_ticket_lifecycle.py -> results/ticket_lifecycle_analysis.json (VERIFIED)
- python scripts/walk_forward_lookback_grid.py --output results/walk_forward_lookback_grid.json (VERIFIED)

# Proxy Review

**Key Finding:** The "contradiction" (30.9% vs 0.0%) is NOT a contradiction - it compares different methodologies:
1. `ticket_lifecycle_analysis.json`: Frequency strategy walk-forward = +30.9% avg ROI (12 iterations)
2. `walk_forward_lookback_grid.json`: Position rule layer delta_roi = 0.0 (rules == baseline)

**APPROVED** - Plan is correct. EXECUTOR should document methodology differences and update HYPOTHESES_CATALOG.md for clarity.
