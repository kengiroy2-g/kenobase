task: FEAT-001
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_IMPL
reviewed_handoff: "ki6_FEAT-001_EXECUTOR_20251230_025306.md"
summary:
  - DrawFeatureExtractor implemented as unified interface for draw feature extraction
  - 4 features correctly implemented: sum (int), decade_counts (tuple[7]), entropy (bits), uniqueness (0-1)
  - Integration with decade_affinity.py verified (NUM_DECADES=7, get_decade() correct)
  - All 28 unit tests pass (100% coverage of feature extraction logic)
  - Exports added to __init__.py following existing pattern (lines 271-277, 523-528)
  - Syntax validation passed (py_compile)
  - Module imports work from both direct and package-level paths
  - No Known Bugs reproduced (BUG-001 to BUG-010 not applicable)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): sum (int), decade_counts (tuple[int,7]), entropy (float, bits), uniqueness (float, 0-1)
- Rule 4 (target metric): Null model comparison via feature vectors
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_draw_features.py -v` -> 28 passed

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw
- Semantics: sum, decade_counts[7], entropy, uniqueness
- Target metric: Feature vectors for NullModelRunner comparison

## Repro Commands
- `python -m py_compile kenobase/analysis/draw_features.py` -> Syntax OK
- `python -c "from kenobase.analysis import DrawFeatures; print('OK')"` -> OK
- `pytest tests/unit/test_draw_features.py -v` -> 28 passed

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

**MECHANISCH** ✓ All 3 files created/modified, syntax OK, 28/28 tests pass

**ARCHITEKTUR** ✓ Follows Axiom-First paradigm, integrates with decade_affinity, frozen dataclass

**INTEGRATION** ✓ Exports in __init__.py, no orchestrator changes needed, no config changes

**KNOWN BUGS** ✓ None applicable (BUG-001 to BUG-010 checked)
