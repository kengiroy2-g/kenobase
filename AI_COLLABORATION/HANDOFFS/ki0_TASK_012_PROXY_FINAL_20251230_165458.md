status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_012
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - HYP_002 High-Wins test fully implemented and documented
  - JSON artifact contains valid hyp002 section with chi2/p-value fields
  - Chi-square N<5 guard correctly prevents invalid statistical claims
  - HYPOTHESES_CATALOG updated with detailed HYP_002 section (lines 111-151)
  - Result: NOT_SIGNIFICANT due to insufficient sample (0 cooldown vs 1 normal HW)
  - All validator checks passed (syntax, artifact, repro)
  - User-ready: No breaking changes, standalone backtest extension
  - Repro verified: `python scripts/backtest_post_jackpot.py`
---
# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-period (30-day windows post-jackpot vs normal)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): High-Wins >= 100 EUR; Cooldown = 30 days post-GK10_10
- Rule 4 (target metric): High-Wins frequency ratio (cooldown vs normal)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/backtest_post_jackpot.py` -> `results/post_jackpot_backtest.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-period (30-day windows)
- Semantics: High-Wins = wins >= 100 EUR per keno_quotes.py
- Target metric: High-Wins frequency ratio (cooldown vs normal)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/backtest_post_jackpot.py` -> `results/post_jackpot_backtest.json`

# Proxy Final Review

## Validator Checks Verified
| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Python syntax | PASS |
| JSON artifact structure | PASS - hyp002 section present |
| Chi-square guard (N<5) | PASS - lines 405-408 |
| HYPOTHESES_CATALOG update | PASS - lines 111-151 |
| Script execution | PASS |

## Final Assessment

**COMPLETE** - Task TASK_012 (HYP_002 High-Wins Test) fully implemented, validated, and documented. The NOT_SIGNIFICANT result is scientifically honest given the sample size constraints (0 vs 1 high-wins in ~640 draws).

**Handoff:** `AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki0_TASK_012_PROXY_FINAL_20251230_165458.md`
