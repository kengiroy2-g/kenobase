status: REJECTED
task: TASK_022
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_TASK_022_ARCHITECT_20251230_192416.md"
summary:
  - Plan lacks mandatory recovery step for missing `AI_COLLABORATION/SYSTEM_STATUS.json`; violates context-sync rule.
  - Required proxy profile `AI_COLLABORATION/KI_PROFILES/ki0_proxy.md` not found; integration/Known Bugs cannot be applied.
  - Implementierungsplan ansonsten schlüssig (Hypothese, Datenpfade, Repro), aber Blocker müssen vor Executor behoben werden.

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): UNVERIFIED (SYSTEM_STATUS.json not present; ki0_proxy profile missing)
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (phase-stratified checks)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): overlap_count=|numbers_t ∩ numbers_{t-1}|; overlap_birthday_ratio=birthday_overlap/overlap_count; phases {PRE_JACKPOT, POST_JACKPOT, COOLDOWN, NORMAL}
- Rule 4 (target metric): accuracy (observed vs hypergeometric expectation)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py -> results/overlap_statistics.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (phase-stratified)
- Semantics: consecutive-draw overlap_count and overlap_birthday_ratio vs hypergeometric(70,20,20) expectation
- Target metric: accuracy (deviation vs expected mean/distribution)

## Repro Commands
- python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py -> results/overlap_statistics.json

# Proxy Review
- Blocking gap: SYSTEM_STATUS.json is missing; plan must add a first step to locate or create it before any analysis to satisfy mandatory workflow.
- Missing proxy profile: `AI_COLLABORATION/KI_PROFILES/ki0_proxy.md` not in repo; Known Bugs/Integration Points cannot be validated—needs resolution or replacement path.
- After these gating fixes, the rest of the plan (hypothesis clarity, data validation, reproduction, reporting) is acceptable.
