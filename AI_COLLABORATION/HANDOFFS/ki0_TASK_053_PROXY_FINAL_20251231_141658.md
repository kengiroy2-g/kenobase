status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_053
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - Script scripts/analyze_typ10_highwin.py (407 lines) validates and executes correctly
  - All probability calculations independently verified: P(9/10)=2.117e-05, P(10/10)=4.657e-07
  - Wait times correct: 47,237 draws (9/10), 2,147,180 draws (10/10)
  - Poisson null-hypothesis correctly computed: P(0|9/10)=95.37%, P(0|10/10)=99.90%
  - JSON output valid with complete structure (63 lines)
  - Quotes match keno_quotes.py single source of truth
  - Baseline comparison to Typ-6,7,8,9 methodologically consistent
  - No architecture decisions needed - follows existing forensik pattern

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (all historical draws)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): high-win = 9/10 OR 10/10 hits; payouts per keno_quotes.py
- Rule 4 (target metric): Poisson p-value (null-hypothesis consistency)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (standalone forensik script)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_typ10_highwin.py` -> `results/typ10_highwin_forensik.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (all historical draws 2018-2025)
- Semantics: Typ-10 high-win = 9/10 (1000 EUR) OR 10/10 (100000 EUR) hits
- Target metric: Poisson p-value for observing 0 events given expected count

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_typ10_highwin.py` -> `results/typ10_highwin_forensik.json`

# Proxy Final Review

## Validator Check Coverage
All 5 critical aspects verified by Validator:
1. Syntax validation
2. Probability math (independently verified)
3. JSON output validity
4. Quotes consistency with keno_quotes.py
5. Script execution

## User Acceptance Assessment
The deliverable meets user expectations:
- Follows established forensik script pattern (analyze_typ9_highwin.py)
- Null-result documentation is scientifically rigorous
- No speculation - pure combinatorial probability bounds
- Baseline comparison to other Typ-X provides valuable context

## Architecture Questions
None - no breaking changes, follows established patterns.

## Final Decision
**COMPLETE** - All acceptance criteria met. Task TASK_053 is finished.

**Handoff**: `AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki0_TASK_053_PROXY_FINAL_20251231_141658.md`
