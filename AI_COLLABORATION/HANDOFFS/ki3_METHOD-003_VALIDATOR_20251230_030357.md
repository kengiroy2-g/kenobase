summary:
  - MI implementation verified at alternative_coupling.py:346-452
  - Formula correct: MI = sum p(x,y) * log2(p(x,y) / (p(x)*p(y))) at lines 417-422
  - Permutation null model at lines 429-432 with configurable n_permutations
  - All 3 unit tests pass (pytest verified in this session)
  - Integration verified: exported in __all__ (line 764), run_all_methods (line 688)
  - Sanity check passed: identical series MI=2.83 bits (high), independent MI=0.45 bits (low)
  - FDR correction available via apply_fdr_correction()
  - Task METHOD-003 COMPLETE - no code changes needed

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (cross-lottery pair-wise coupling)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): MI in bits = sum p(x,y) * log2(p(x,y) / (p(x)*p(y)))
- Rule 4 (target metric): coupling detection (p-value <= alpha after permutation test)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_alternative_coupling.py::TestMutualInformationLagged -v` -> 3 passed

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (cross-lottery pair-wise coupling)
- Semantics: MI in bits measuring information shared between lagged source and target series
- Target metric: coupling detection via permutation test p-value

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_alternative_coupling.py::TestMutualInformationLagged -v` -> 3 passed

# Validation

**Test Results:** 3/3 passed in 1.74s

**Code Quality:** MI formula verified at line 417-422, permutation null at 429-432, properly exported and integrated.

**Sanity Check:** Identical series MI=2.83 bits (high), Independent MI=0.45 bits (low) - correct behavior.
