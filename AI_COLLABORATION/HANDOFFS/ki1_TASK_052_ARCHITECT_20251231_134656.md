**TASK_052 ARCHITECT Summary:**

The PROXY rejection was **correct**. After verification:

1. **Data verification**: `high_win_forensik.json` contains 0 Typ-9 events, `high_payout_backtest_2018_2024.json` shows all 8 Typ-9 tickets with `high_payout_count: 0`

2. **Statistical analysis**: 
   - theoretical_p_high ≈ 9.94e-5 per draw
   - E[events] = 2,237 × 8 × 9.94e-5 = 1.76
   - P(X=0|λ=1.76) ≈ 17.2% → **observing 0 is plausible**

3. **Revised deliverable**: NULL_RESULT documentation instead of forensik analysis
   - Create `results/typ9_null_result_analysis.json`
   - Update `HYPOTHESES_CATALOG.md` with HYP-TYP9-001

4. **Event horizon**: Need ~30,000 draws (82 years) for 95% confidence of ≥1 event per ticket
