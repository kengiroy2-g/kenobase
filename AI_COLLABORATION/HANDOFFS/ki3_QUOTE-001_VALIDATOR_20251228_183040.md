validated_handoff: "ki3_QUOTE-001_VALIDATOR_20251228_181739.md"
summary:
  - Document docs/keno_quotes.md has been CORRECTED since last validation
  - Formula (line 34) is CORRECT: P(k|n) = C(n,k)*C(70-n,20-k)/C(70,20)
  - All 9 KENO type ROI values now match calculated correct values
  - Summary table (Section 12, lines 276-284) now consistent with detailed sections
  - Erkenntnisse updated correctly (Typ 3 best 50.68%, Typ 8 worst 43.25%)
  - All detailed probability tables (Sections 3-11) verified correct
  - AC2 (Probabilities) PASS, AC4 (ROI) PASS
  - Document ready for production use

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-keno-type (Types 2-10)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): P(k|n) = C(n,k)*C(70-n,20-k)/C(70,20), ROI = sum(P(k)*Quote(k))
- Rule 4 (target metric): mathematical accuracy (tolerance <1pp)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -c "..."` command in handoff file

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-keno-type
- Semantics: Hypergeometric probability for KENO draws (20 from 70)
- Target metric: Mathematical accuracy within 0.01pp

## Repro Commands
- `python -c "from math import comb; ..."` -> stdout (see handoff for full command)

# Validation

**Result: APPROVED**

All 9 KENO types verified with 0.00pp error. Document `docs/keno_quotes.md` is mathematically correct and internally consistent.

**Handoff Created:**
