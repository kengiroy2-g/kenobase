status: REJECTED
task: DOC-001
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - Data claims (r=0.3921, Winner-Ratio 1.3x, 6.982 Ziehungen) in `docs/strategies/anti_birthday.md:9-33` with source ref at `docs/strategies/anti_birthday.md:343-345` lack required repro command/artifact path/filter/N → reproducibility rule not met.
  - Mandatory context check failed: `AI_COLLABORATION/SYSTEM_STATUS.json` not found, so Rule 1 only partially verified; CURRENT_STATUS remains UNVERIFIED.
  - Proxy handoff recorded at `AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki0_DOC-001_PROXY_FINAL_20251228_184951.md` with status REJECTED.
  - No additional tests executed (per efficiency rule; validator already ran `python scripts/backtest_anti_birthday.py --help`).

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): UNVERIFIED (SYSTEM_STATUS.json missing; git status collected)
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): anti_birthday_score, winner_ratio, birthday_score, competition_reduction fields
- Rule 4 (target metric): bet-selection (competition/payout share reduction)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): UNVERIFIED (no documented command to reproduce metrics)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global
- Semantics: anti_birthday_score (share of numbers 32-70), birthday_score (share 1-31), winner_ratio (1.3x more winners on birthday-heavy draws), expected_competition_reduction (derived from winner_ratio), analyzed_draws (6,982)
- Target metric: bet-selection (competition reduction / payout share)

## Repro Commands
- UNVERIFIED (no command provided to reproduce r=0.3921, Winner-Ratio 1.3x, 6.982 draws metrics)

# Proxy Final Review
Handoff set to REJECTED because the strategy doc lacks the mandatory reproducibility link between metrics and artifacts (no command/path/filter/N for the cited r=0.3921/Winner-Ratio/6.982 draws), and SYSTEM_STATUS.json is absent so Rule 1 cannot be fully confirmed. Please add a concrete repro command (with dataset path, filters, N, and expected output location) for the reported metrics, then re-run validation.
