status: APPROVED
task: TASK_020
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_TASK_020_ARCHITECT_20251230_185504.md"
summary:
  - HYP_CYC_006 data verified in results/cycles_comprehensive_analysis.json (lines 260-355)
  - Sample sizes confirmed: PRE_JACKPOT=116, POST_JACKPOT=87, COOLDOWN=121, NORMAL=1133
  - High-Win counts extremely sparse: V2=1 (PRE_JACKPOT only), ORIG=2 (NORMAL typ_10 only)
  - Chi-quadrat test correctly identified as not applicable (expected cells < 5)
  - Fisher-Exact test recommendation is appropriate for sparse 2x2 contingency tables
  - No code changes required - documentation-only task
  - Status correctly assessed as NICHT SIGNIFIKANT due to Sample-Size limitation
  - Repro command verified: `python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py`

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-phase (PRE_JACKPOT, POST_JACKPOT, COOLDOWN, NORMAL)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): v2_highwins (>=100 EUR), v2_rate_per_100
- Rule 4 (target metric): High-Win frequency clustering by cycle phase
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py` -> `results/cycles_comprehensive_analysis.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-phase (4 Phasen)
- Semantics: High-Win = Gewinn >= 100 EUR pro Ziehung
- Target metric: High-Win Rate pro 100 Ziehungen, Clustering nach Phase

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_cycles_comprehensive.py` -> `results/cycles_comprehensive_analysis.json` VERIFIED

# Proxy Review

**APPROVED** - ARCHITECT plan is correct:
1. Data verified in `results/cycles_comprehensive_analysis.json` (HYP_CYC_006 section, lines 260-355)
2. High-Win events are extremely rare (V2: 3 total, ORIG: 2 total in 1457 draws)
3. Chi-quadrat test correctly identified as not applicable (expected < 5)
4. Fisher-Exact is appropriate alternative but data remains sparse
5. Documentation-only update needed (HYPOTHESES_CATALOG.md)
