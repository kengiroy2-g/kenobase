status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_015
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - HYP_005 Birthday-Avoidance Cooldown test implementation verified complete
  - Statistical methodology correct (Mann-Whitney U, one-sided)
  - JSON output valid with 11 jackpots, 5 ticket types, n=314 per strategy
  - Conclusion TREND_V2_BETTER accurate - V2 better in 3/5 types, 0/5 significant
  - Acceptance criteria correctly documented as NOT met (requires p<0.05 AND V2>V1)
  - Avg ROI diff +1.84% verified - marginal trend but no statistical evidence
  - Script reproducible, no user escalation needed

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-ticket-type (Typ 6-10) x Strategie (V1 vs V2)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): V1=OPTIMAL_TICKETS, V2=BIRTHDAY_AVOIDANCE_TICKETS_V2, Cooldown=30d post-GK10_10
- Rule 4 (target metric): ROI-Differenz V2 vs V1 im Cooldown, p<0.05
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/backtest_birthday_cooldown.py` -> `results/hyp005_birthday_cooldown.json` VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-ticket-type (Typ 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
- Semantics: ROI = (won - invested) / invested; Mann-Whitney U for daily wins
- Target metric: Statistical significance p<0.05 for V2 > V1

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/backtest_birthday_cooldown.py` -> `results/hyp005_birthday_cooldown.json`

# Proxy Final Review

## Validator Critical Aspects Checked
All critical aspects verified by Validator:
1. Python syntax - py_compile PASS
2. Statistical test implementation - Mann-Whitney U one-sided correct
3. Aggregation math - avg +1.84% manually verified
4. JSON structure - 6430 lines, valid
5. Conclusion accuracy - TREND_V2_BETTER with 3/5 better, 0/5 significant
6. Acceptance criteria - correctly documented as NOT met

## User Acceptance Assessment
**YES** - This change would be accepted:
- Rigorous scientific methodology
- Honest documentation of negative result (no p-hacking)
- Actionable conclusion: hypothesis shows weak trend but insufficient evidence
- Full reproducibility

## Architecture Questions
**NONE** - No escalation needed:
- Standalone hypothesis test script
- No breaking changes to existing code
- Consistent with Axiom-First paradigm (pre-defined acceptance criteria)

## Final Decision
**COMPLETE** - Task TASK_015 successfully delivered.

Key Finding: Birthday-Avoidance V2 shows marginal trend (+1.84% avg ROI) in post-jackpot cooldown but lacks statistical significance (0/5 tests p<0.05). Hypothesis HYP_005 remains UNCONFIRMED.
