reviewed_handoff: "ki2_TASK_017_EXECUTOR_20251230_180202.md"
summary:
  - Script scripts/test_hyp007_regime_switch.py syntactically valid (py_compile OK)
  - Output results/hyp007_regime_switch.json is valid JSON
  - Typ 9 autocorr = -0.015734 matches existing cycles_comprehensive_analysis.json:255 exactly
  - All 5 types (6-10) tested with 52 periods each, all CONFIRMED (|autocorr| < 0.3)
  - Block-Permutation nullmodel correctly implemented with seed 42 for reproducibility
  - p-values high (0.53-0.89) = observed autocorrs not significantly different from null
  - No integration conflicts (standalone test script, no orchestrator changes needed)
  - No Known Bugs triggered (standalone hypothesis test)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-28-day-block
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): ROI per block = (wins - cost) / cost; autocorr = Pearson lag=1
- Rule 4 (target metric): |autocorrelation| < 0.3 = HYP_007 BESTAETIGT
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED (standalone test, no side effects)
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/test_hyp007_regime_switch.py` -> results/hyp007_regime_switch.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-28-day-block
- Semantics: ROI per 28-day block, Pearson autocorrelation (lag=1), p-value from block-permutation
- Target metric: |autocorrelation| < 0.3 confirms REGIME_WECHSEL

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/test_hyp007_regime_switch.py` -> results/hyp007_regime_switch.json

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

## Verification Results

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Syntax (py_compile) | PASS |
| JSON validity | PASS |
| Typ 9 cross-validation | MATCH (-0.015734) |
| All types CONFIRMED | 5/5 |
| No integration conflicts | N/A (standalone) |
| No Known Bugs | N/A (standalone) |

## Conclusion
Implementation is correct, complete, and matches existing data. No architectural issues. Ready for Validator.
