status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_023
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - HYP_013 correctly REJECTED: overlap and birthday ratio show no phase-dependent deviation
  - Statistical rigor confirmed: Kruskal-Wallis p=0.93 (overlap), p=0.53 (birthday)
  - All pairwise Mann-Whitney tests non-significant (all p_adj>=0.87)
  - Multiple testing corrections (Bonferroni + BH) properly applied
  - Expected values mathematically verified: overlap=5.714, birthday_ratio=0.443
  - Phase assignments valid: PRE(24)+POST(38)+COOLDOWN(274)+NORMAL(1120)=1456 draws
  - REPRO_COMMANDS.md entry verified at lines 184-187
  - Artifact and JSON outputs complete and valid

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (phase-stratified by jackpot cycle)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): overlap_count = |numbers_t ∩ numbers_{t-1}|; birthday_ratio = birthday_numbers_in_overlap / overlap_count
- Rule 4 (target metric): calibration (testing phase-dependent deviations from expected)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/test_hyp013_overlap_birthday_phase.py --draws data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv --jackpots data/processed/ecosystem/timeline_2025.csv --output results/hyp013_overlap_birthday_phase.json` -> results/hyp013_overlap_birthday_phase.json VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (phase-stratified by jackpot cycle)
- Semantics: overlap_count, birthday_ratio, phase labels (PRE/POST/COOLDOWN/NORMAL)
- Target metric: calibration

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/test_hyp013_overlap_birthday_phase.py --draws data/raw/keno/KENO_ab_2022_bereinigt.csv --jackpots data/processed/ecosystem/timeline_2025.csv --output results/hyp013_overlap_birthday_phase.json` -> results/hyp013_overlap_birthday_phase.json VERIFIED

# Proxy Final Review

## Validator Checks Passed
1. Script compiles successfully (py_compile OK)
2. Reproducibility verified (identical outputs on re-run)
3. Expected values mathematically correct
4. Statistical tests with proper multiple testing corrections
5. Decision logic sound

## User Perspective Assessment
- **Would user accept?** YES - rigorous statistical analysis with proper MTC corrections
- **Architecture questions?** NONE - follows existing hypothesis testing framework
- **Breaking changes?** NONE - standalone hypothesis test

## Final Decision
**COMPLETE** - Task meets all acceptance criteria:
- Script produces valid, reproducible JSON output
- Statistical methodology sound (Kruskal-Wallis + pairwise Mann-Whitney with Bonferroni/BH)
- Decision correctly derived: HYP_013 REJECTED (no phase-dependent overlap/birthday deviation)
- REPRO_COMMANDS.md properly documented at lines 184-187
- Artifact markdown written

## Minor Observation
SYSTEM_STATUS.json line 46 lists a different HYP-013 ("Multi-Einsatz Strategie") - ID collision should be resolved in a future task but does not block this task.
