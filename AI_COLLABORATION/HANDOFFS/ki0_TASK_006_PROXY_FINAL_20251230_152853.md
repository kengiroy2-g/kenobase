status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_006
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - Validator confirmed all 19 unit tests pass (tests/unit/test_distribution.py)
  - Module syntax validated (py_compile OK)
  - Module exports verified: analyze_distribution, detect_anomalies, create_summary
  - JSON result validated: distribution_analysis_2025.json is valid and parseable
  - Key metrics present: CV=0.97 daily, CV=0.36 weekly, 17 jackpot-10 hits
  - Granularity correct: per-keno-type (2-10) and per-gewinnklasse (0-10 matches)
  - Implementation was already complete - no code changes required
  - No architecture decisions or user escalation needed

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-keno-type and per-gewinnklasse
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): CV=coefficient of variation, mean/std winners, skewness, kurtosis
- Rule 4 (target metric): distribution stability (CV) and anomaly detection
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_distribution.py` -> `results/distribution_analysis_2025.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-keno-type (2-10) and per-gewinnklasse (0-10 matches)
- Semantics: CV (coefficient of variation), mean/std winners, skewness, kurtosis
- Target metric: distribution stability (CV) and anomaly detection

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_distribution.py -v` -> 19 passed
- `python scripts/analyze_distribution.py` -> `results/distribution_analysis_2025.json`

# Proxy Final Review

## Validator Coverage
Validator (ki3) performed comprehensive checks:
1. 19/19 unit tests passed
2. Module syntax validated (py_compile OK)
3. Module exports verified in __init__.py (lines 39-41, 371-373)
4. JSON result valid and parseable
5. 362 draws analyzed (2025-01-01 to 2025-12-28)

## User Acceptance
- Implementation was already complete
- No code changes required
- Standard analysis module following established patterns
- No breaking changes

## Architecture
- No open architecture questions
- Clean pipeline integration
- Follows Axiom-First paradigm

## Final Decision
**APPROVED for COMPLETE status** - No escalation needed.
