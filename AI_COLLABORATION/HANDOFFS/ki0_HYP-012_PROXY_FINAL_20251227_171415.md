status: COMPLETE
task: HYP-012
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - All 15 unit tests PASS (verified by VALIDATOR, 0.73s)
  - Syntax check passed for all 4 WORKING SET files  
  - Module exports verified via kenobase.analysis (run_hyp012_analysis)
  - CLI script runs end-to-end with 365 real draws
  - JSON output valid with expected keys (correlation, classification, interpretation)
  - Code follows established HYP-010 pattern (dataclasses, scipy stats, logging)
  - Acceptance Criteria MET: Pearson/Spearman correlations computed, significance flagged at p<0.05
  - No escalation needed - implementation is clean and consistent with project patterns

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw (70 KENO numbers across all draws)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): Spieleinsatz, Total_Auszahlung, Restbetrag, z1-z20
- Rule 4 (target metric): Pearson/Spearman correlation coefficients (p < 0.05 threshold)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_hyp012.py` -> `results/hyp012_stake_correlation.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw (correlation per number across 70 KENO numbers)
- Semantics: Spieleinsatz (stake), Total_Auszahlung (payout), Restbetrag (remainder), z1-z20 (drawn numbers)
- Target metric: Pearson/Spearman correlation between draw frequency and stake amounts

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_stake_correlation.py -v` -> 15/15 passed (0.73s)
- `python scripts/analyze_hyp012.py` -> `results/hyp012_stake_correlation.json`

# Proxy Final Review

## Summary

VALIDATOR has thoroughly validated HYP-012 implementation:
- **15/15 unit tests pass** in 0.73s
- **All 4 WORKING SET files** have valid syntax
- **Module exports** properly integrated into `kenobase.analysis`
- **CLI script** runs end-to-end with real data (365 draws)
- **JSON output** is valid and contains expected structure

## Final Decision

**STATUS: COMPLETE**

No escalation needed. Implementation is:
1. Well-tested (15 tests, edge cases covered)
2. Follows project patterns (HYP-010 template)
3. Properly integrated (exports in `__init__.py`)
4. User-ready (CLI with interpretation output)
