status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_052
role: ARCHITECT
phase: ARCHITECT
files_changed: []
summary:
  - VERIFIED: Typ-9 has 0 high-win events in 2018-2025 data (N=2600 draws total)
  - Theoretical P(8/9)=9.94e-05 means ~1 event per 10,000 draws expected
  - Recommended approach: Null-Result-Forensik documenting WHY no events occurred
  - Script analyze_typ9_highwin.py will document theoretical expectations vs reality
  - Comparison with Typ-6/Typ-7 as baseline (which have actual events)
  - Output includes expected wait time, confidence intervals, probability bounds
  - No filtering from forensik.json needed - direct calculation from backtest data
  - Task scope: Document absence + theoretical analysis (not event forensics)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-ticket-type
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): keno_type=9, high_payout_threshold=400 EUR (8/9=1000 EUR)
- Rule 4 (target metric): event_count, theoretical_p_high, expected_wait_draws
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): python scripts/analyze_typ9_highwin.py -> results/typ9_highwin_forensik.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-ticket-type (Typ-9 vs Typ-6/Typ-7 baseline)
- Semantics: high_payout_threshold=400 EUR, 8/9 hits=1000 EUR, 9/9 hits=50000 EUR
- Target metric: event_count (observed=0), theoretical probability, expected wait time

## Repro Commands
- python scripts/analyze_typ9_highwin.py -> results/typ9_highwin_forensik.json
