summary:
  - ARCHITECT misidentified where threshold filtering occurs
  - analyze_high_win_forensik.py has NO --threshold param (verified lines 403-429)
  - Threshold filtering happens in backtest_high_payout_tickets.py (line 249-252)
  - Forensik script reads pre-filtered high_payout_events from backtest JSON
  - Correct workflow: backtest with threshold 451 THEN forensik on output
  - Repro command in handoff is WRONG - would fail with "unrecognized arguments"
---

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-event (correct)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): high-win = payout > 450 EUR (correct)
- Rule 4 (target metric): forensik descriptive (correct)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): UNVERIFIED - proposed command would FAIL

## Repro Commands
- PROPOSED (WRONG): `python scripts/analyze_high_win_forensik.py --threshold 451` -> FAILS
- CORRECT: Two-step workflow in handoff file
