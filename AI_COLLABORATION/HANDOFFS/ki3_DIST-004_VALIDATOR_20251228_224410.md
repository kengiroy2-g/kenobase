summary:
  - All 31 tests pass in test_popularity_correlation.py (0.99s)
  - Syntax OK for popularity_correlation.py and analyze_popularity_proxy.py
  - BirthdayCorrelationResult dataclass at line 472 with correct fields
  - calculate_birthday_score() at line 494 correctly computes 1-31 fraction
  - correlate_birthday_with_winners() at line 509 with rolling-window stability
  - __all__ exports verified at line 648 (13 items including new functions)
  - CLI --help works correctly with all expected options
  - results/popularity_proxy.json correctly reports NO_DATA when GQ unavailable

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): birthday_score (0-1 fraction of 1-31 numbers), winners (GQ sum), Spearman r
- Rule 4 (target metric): correlation r > 0.3 with p < 0.05
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_popularity_correlation.py -v` -> 31 passed

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw
- Semantics: birthday_score (fraction of numbers in 1-31 range), winners (sum of GQ winners), Spearman correlation
- Target metric: r > 0.3 with p < 0.05 supports hypothesis

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_popularity_correlation.py -v` -> 31 passed (0.99s)
- `python scripts/analyze_popularity_proxy.py --help` -> CLI functional

# Validation

**VERDICT: APPROVED** - All 31 tests pass, syntax verified, exports complete, CLI functional.
