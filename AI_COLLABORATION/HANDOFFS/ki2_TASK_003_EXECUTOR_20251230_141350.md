status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_003
role: EXECUTOR
phase: EXECUTOR
files_changed:
  - kenobase/analysis/cycle_phases.py (NEW)
  - tests/unit/test_cycle_phases.py (NEW)
  - kenobase/analysis/__init__.py (UPDATED)
summary:
  - Created kenobase/analysis/cycle_phases.py with Phase enum (COOLDOWN/GROWTH/HOT/UNKNOWN)
  - Phase boundaries implemented: COOLDOWN=0-30d, GROWTH=31-60d, HOT=>60d nach Jackpot
  - REUSED load_gk1_events() and get_jackpot_dates() from jackpot_correlation.py (as per plan)
  - Created 33 unit tests covering all edge cases (boundaries, no jackpots, multiple jackpots)
  - All 33 tests pass (pytest tests/unit/test_cycle_phases.py -v)
  - Exported Phase, PhaseLabel, label_phases, filter_draws_by_phase, get_phase_statistics from __init__.py
  - Helper functions get_phase_for_days() and get_phase_for_date() for single-value lookups

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): Phase enum (COOLDOWN|GROWTH|HOT|UNKNOWN), days_since_jackpot int
- Rule 4 (target metric): phase-coverage (100% Ziehungen haben Phase-Label)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): pytest tests/unit/test_cycle_phases.py -v -> 33 passed

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw (jede KENO-Ziehung erhaelt Phase-Label)
- Semantics: Phase.COOLDOWN (0-30d), Phase.GROWTH (31-60d), Phase.HOT (>60d), Phase.UNKNOWN (vor erstem Jackpot)
- Target metric: phase-coverage + Unit-Test pass rate

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_cycle_phases.py -v` -> 33 passed in 1.82s
