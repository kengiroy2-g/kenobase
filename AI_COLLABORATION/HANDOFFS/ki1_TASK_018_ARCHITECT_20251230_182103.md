**ARCHITECT Phase COMPLETE**

**Handoff:** `AI_COLLABORATION/HANDOFFS/ki1_TASK_018_ARCHITECT_20251230_182103.md`

**Key corrections from PROXY rejection:**
1. ID changed from HYP-008 → **WL-008** (avoids collision with falsified "111-Prinzip")
2. Explicit differentiation from HYP_CYC_001 (28-day vs year/quarter granularity)
3. Script renamed to `test_wl008_year_cycles.py`

**Next phase:** PROXY review → EXECUTOR implementation
