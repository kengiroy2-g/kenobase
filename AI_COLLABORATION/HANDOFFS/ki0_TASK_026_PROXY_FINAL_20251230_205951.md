status: COMPLETE
task: TASK_026
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - Validator passed all 12/12 tests (syntax, JSON validity, BH/FDR, reproducibility)
  - Script correctly implements frozen-rule transfer matrix (train Year X -> test Year Y)
  - Output results/yearly_transfer_matrix.json complete (7 keys, 36 OOS year-pairs)
  - Key finding: 0/48 FDR-significant, mean OOS delta_roi=-9.51pp (rules hurt vs baseline)
  - In-sample overfitting confirmed: all delta_roi > 0 (+16.85 to +298.90pp)
  - Axiom-First compliance verified: frozen rules, OOS testing, BH/FDR correction
  - No architecture violations, no escalation needed
  - Scientifically honest null result showing lack of OOS generalization

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-year-pair
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): train_year, test_year, delta_roi, fdr_significant, rules_roi, baseline_roi
- Rule 4 (target metric): generalization (ROI transfer stability across year-pairs)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/walk_forward_yearly_transfer.py --output results/yearly_transfer_matrix.json` -> results/yearly_transfer_matrix.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-year-pair (train_year x test_year x keno_type)
- Semantics: delta_roi = rules_roi - baseline_roi, fdr_significant via BH correction at alpha=0.10
- Target metric: OOS ROI generalization

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/walk_forward_yearly_transfer.py --output results/yearly_transfer_matrix.json`

# Proxy Final Review

## Final Decision: COMPLETE

All criteria satisfied:
1. Validator validated all critical aspects (12/12 tests PASS)
2. User would accept this scientifically honest result
3. No open architecture questions requiring user decision
