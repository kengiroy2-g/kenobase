status: ESCALATE
task: TASK-R04
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_TASK-R04_ARCHITECT_20251228_064338.md"
summary:
  - ARCHITECT correctly identified BLOCKER: EuroJackpot CSV has no host_country field
  - Plan proposes country_rotation.py analog to regional_affinity.py - architecturally sound
  - CRITICAL ISSUE: Laender-Rotation concept factually incorrect - EuroJackpot drawn centrally in Helsinki
  - EuroJackpot has 18 participating countries but draws NOT rotated between them
  - Escalating for user decision before implementing code for non-existent phenomenon

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-country
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): EuroJackpot host country rotation
- Rule 4 (target metric): bet-selection
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): UNVERIFIED (plan-only)

## PROBLEM
EuroJackpot draws are conducted centrally in **Helsinki, Finland** - there is no country rotation. The CSV correctly has no country field because there is no rotation to track.

## OPTIONEN
- **A: REJECT** - Close task as "not applicable"
- **B: PIVOT** - Analyze participation patterns (LOW feasibility, needs external data)
- **C: PIVOT** - Time-based analysis with existing temporal_cycles.py (HIGH feasibility)

## User Decision Required
1. Close TASK-R04 as "not applicable"?
2. Pivot to temporal analysis (Option C)?
3. Additional information about EuroJackpot hosting?
