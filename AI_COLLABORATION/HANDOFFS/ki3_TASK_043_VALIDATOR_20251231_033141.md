summary:
  - Script executes correctly: `python scripts/validate_win_frequency.py -v` completes in ~1.3s
  - N=1457 draws, 48 months (2022-01 to 2025-12) verified
  - Typ-6/8/10 = 100% months with wins (48/48) PASS
  - Typ-2 = 91.7% (44/48) FAIL - expected due to combinatorial limitation
  - Random baseline confirms Typ-2 structural issue (only 18% pass, vs 100% for Typ-6+)
  - JSON output valid, A3 PARTIAL conclusion semantically correct
  - Architecture: DataLoader.load() API correctly used
  - Exit code: 1 (correct for partial validation)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-ticket-type (Typ-2, Typ-6, Typ-8, Typ-10)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): winning_month = month with >=2 matches at least once
- Rule 4 (target metric): win_frequency_per_month (threshold: >95%)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/validate_win_frequency.py -v` -> results/win_frequency_validation.json

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-ticket-type (Typ-2, Typ-6, Typ-8, Typ-10)
- Semantics: A month counts as "winning" if ticket achieves >=2 matches at least once
- Target metric: win_frequency = months_with_win / total_months (acceptance: >95%)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/validate_win_frequency.py -v` -> results/win_frequency_validation.json

# Validation

## Test Execution (PASS)
- Script runs without errors
- JSON output parseable and consistent between runs

## Data Verification (PASS)
- Typ-2 zero-win months: 2022-02, 2023-06, 2025-02, 2025-07 (4 months identified)

## Conclusion
**APPROVED** - A3 axiom correctly validated. Typ-2 limitation is combinatorially expected (only 2 numbers chosen).
