validated_handoff: "ki0_TASK_027_PROXY_IMPL_20251230_211151.md"
summary:
  - Script syntax validated: py_compile OK
  - JSON output valid and correctly structured at results/walk_forward_lookback_grid.json
  - Lookback grid [30, 60, 90, 180, 365, 540, 730] correctly implemented per plan
  - BH/FDR correction unit tested: 4/4 test cases pass
  - Per-keno_type granularity maintained (typ_6 through typ_10), BUG-001 avoided
  - delta_roi = rules_roi - baseline_roi correctly computed per type
  - 35 comparisons (7 lookbacks x 5 types), 0 FDR-significant (scientifically valid null result)
  - Quick mode (--quick) functional, runtime <0.5s

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-keno_type (Typ 6-10)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): recent_draws = lookback window (days), delta_roi = rules_roi - baseline_roi
- Rule 4 (target metric): delta_roi (ROI improvement)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/walk_forward_lookback_grid.py --output results/walk_forward_lookback_grid.json` -> results/walk_forward_lookback_grid.json CONFIRMED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-keno_type (Typ 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
- Semantics: recent_draws = lookback period in days, delta_roi = difference between rules-based ROI and baseline frequency ROI
- Target metric: delta_roi (ROI improvement)

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/walk_forward_lookback_grid.py --output results/walk_forward_lookback_grid.json` -> results/walk_forward_lookback_grid.json

# Validation

**All tests passed:**
1. Syntax validation: OK
2. JSON structure validation: OK  
3. Lookback grid matches plan [30, 60, 90, 180, 365, 540, 730]: OK
4. BH/FDR unit tests: 4/4 PASS
5. Per-type granularity (BUG-001 avoided): OK
6. Quick mode functional: OK
