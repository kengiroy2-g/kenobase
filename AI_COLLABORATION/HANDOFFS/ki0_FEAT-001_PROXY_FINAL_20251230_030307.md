status: COMPLETE
task: FEAT-001
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - All 28 unit tests pass (pytest tests/unit/test_draw_features.py -v, 1.02s)
  - DrawFeatureExtractor implemented with 4 features (sum, decade_counts, entropy, uniqueness)
  - Package imports verified (from kenobase.analysis import DrawFeatures works)
  - Exports in __init__.py at lines 272-274, 524-526
  - Entropy correctly bounded [0, log2(7) ~ 2.807 bits]
  - Uniqueness 0-1 with frequency-based or heuristic fallback
  - Integration with decade_affinity verified (NUM_DECADES=7)
  - Task FEAT-001 ready for merge - no user escalation needed

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): sum (int), decade_counts (tuple[int,7]), entropy (float, bits), uniqueness (float, 0-1)
- Rule 4 (target metric): Feature vectors for NullModelRunner comparison
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_draw_features.py -v` -> 28 passed (1.02s)

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw
- Semantics: sum, decade_counts[7], entropy (bits), uniqueness (0-1)
- Target metric: Feature vectors for NullModelRunner comparison

## Repro Commands
- `python -m py_compile kenobase/analysis/draw_features.py` -> Syntax OK
- `python -c "from kenobase.analysis import DrawFeatures; print('OK')"` -> OK
- `pytest tests/unit/test_draw_features.py -v` -> 28 passed

# Proxy Final Review

## Validator Checks Assessment
Validator verified all critical aspects:
1. Tests pass (28/28)
2. Syntax OK
3. Package imports work
4. Dataclass properly frozen with serialization methods
5. Numeric output for NullModelRunner (to_vector shape (10,))
6. Correct decade_affinity integration
7. Entropy math correct (bits, log2)
8. Proper __init__.py exports

## User Acceptance Assessment
**YES** - User would accept this change:
- Clean axiom-first design (features, not patterns)
- Well-tested
- Non-breaking
- Extensible

## Architecture Questions
None - follows kenobase/analysis/ patterns

## Final Decision
**COMPLETE** - No escalation needed
