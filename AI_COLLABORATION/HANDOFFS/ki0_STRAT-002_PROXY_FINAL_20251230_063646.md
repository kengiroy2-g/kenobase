status: COMPLETE
task: STRAT-002
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - APPROVED: Zahlen-Arbitrage module complete with all 3 files (number_arbitrage.py, backtest script, tests)
  - All 13/13 unit tests PASS - full test coverage
  - Backtest JSON valid with 7 required keys, Train/Test split verified (2022-2023 vs 2024+)
  - Scientific result: 0 rules discovered, edge does NOT persist - confirms Axiom A1 (House-Edge)
  - Null model baseline established: mean_max_lift=0.929, 95th_pctl=3.046 (50 permutations)
  - EuroJackpot negative control shows 0 rules - confirms Axiom-First methodology
  - No architecture decisions needed - follows established patterns
  - Ready for commit - no user escalation required

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-number-pair
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): ArbitrageRule dataclass with trigger_number/target_number/lag_days/lift/q_value
- Rule 4 (target metric): Out-of-Sample Lift > 1.1 AND p_value < 0.05
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/backtest_number_arbitrage.py` -> `results/number_arbitrage_backtest.json` VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-number-pair
- Semantics: ArbitrageRule with trigger_number/target_number/lag_days/lift/q_value
- Target metric: Out-of-Sample Lift > 1.1 AND p_value < 0.05

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/backtest_number_arbitrage.py` -> `results/number_arbitrage_backtest.json` VERIFIED
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_number_arbitrage.py -v` -> 13 passed (4.99s) VERIFIED

# Proxy Final Review

## Validator Coverage Assessment
Validator thoroughly checked all critical aspects:
1. Syntax verification (py_compile) - PASS
2. Unit tests (13/13) - PASS
3. Backtest JSON structure (7 keys) - PASS
4. Train/Test split dates - VERIFIED
5. Scientific methodology - PASS
6. Axiom A1 compliance - VERIFIED

## User Acceptance Assessment
All deliverables meet acceptance criteria. The scientific result (0 rules discovered) is the EXPECTED outcome per Axiom A1 (House-Edge guarantee). This falsifies the number-pair arbitrage hypothesis with proper methodology.

## Final Decision
**COMPLETE** - No escalation needed. Implementation follows established patterns, tests pass, methodology is sound.
