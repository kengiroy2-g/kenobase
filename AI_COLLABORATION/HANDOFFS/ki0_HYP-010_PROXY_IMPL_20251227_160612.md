phase: PROXY_IMPL
reviewed_handoff: "ki2_HYP-010_EXECUTOR_20251227_160012.md"
summary:
  - odds_correlation.py (557 lines) - Well-structured module with proper dataclasses
  - German number format handling (1.443 = 1443) correctly implemented
  - Pearson + Spearman dual correlation via scipy.stats
  - safe/popular classification with median +/- 1 std threshold
  - CLI script with proper argparse and JSON output
  - __init__.py correctly exports all 10 public symbols
  - 15 unit tests all passing (0.79s)
  - Analysis result: r=0.08, p=0.49 - NOT SIGNIFICANT

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-draw + per-number aggregation
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): winner_count per Keno-Typ/date, avg_winners per number
- Rule 4 (target metric): Pearson/Spearman correlation with p-value
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_hyp010.py` -> `results/hyp010_odds_correlation.json`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-draw (join) + per-number (aggregation)
- Semantics: winner_count = Anzahl der Gewinner, weighted by Keno-Typ/10
- Target metric: Pearson/Spearman correlation

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_hyp010.py` -> `results/hyp010_odds_correlation.json`
- `pytest tests/unit/test_odds_correlation.py -v` -> 15/15 passed

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

| MECHANISCH | PASS | Syntax valid, 15/15 tests pass, JSON output valid |
| ARCHITEKTUR | PASS | Follows popularity_correlation.py pattern, proper types/docstrings |
| INTEGRATION | PASS | __init__.py exports correct, no name collisions |
| KNOWN BUGS | PASS | None of BUG-001 through BUG-010 reproduced |

## Verdict

**APPROVED** - Ready for VALIDATOR phase.
