  - AI_COLLABORATION/KNOWLEDGE_BASE/HYPOTHESES_CATALOG.md
summary:
  - Validated walk-forward claims from 3 artifacts (ticket_lifecycle, walk_forward_lookback_grid, walk_forward_param_grid)
  - RECONCILED apparent contradiction: 30.9% ROI vs 0.0% delta_roi are DIFFERENT methodologies
  - ticket_lifecycle_analysis.json: Frequency strategy avg_roi=+30.9% (12 iterations, 1 outlier HW)
  - walk_forward_lookback_grid.json: Position-Rule delta_roi=0.0 for ALL 35 comparisons (no improvement)
  - FDR correction confirmed: 0/35 significant results (BH alpha=0.1)
  - Updated HYPOTHESES_CATALOG.md with reconciliation section and changelog entry
  - All repro commands verified: scripts/analyze_ticket_lifecycle.py, scripts/walk_forward_lookback_grid.py
  - No code changes needed - documentation clarification only

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-strategy (frequency, frequency_high, v2_style) + per-type (Typ-6 to Typ-10)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): avg_roi (absolute), delta_roi (improvement over baseline)
- Rule 4 (target metric): Reconciliation of claims + documentation update
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility):
  - `python scripts/analyze_ticket_lifecycle.py` -> `results/ticket_lifecycle_analysis.json` VERIFIED
  - `python scripts/walk_forward_lookback_grid.py` -> `results/walk_forward_lookback_grid.json` VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-strategy + per-keno-type
- Semantics: avg_roi (frequency strategy ROI), delta_roi (rules_roi - baseline_roi)
- Target metric: Documentation reconciliation of walk-forward claims

## Repro Commands
- `python scripts/analyze_ticket_lifecycle.py` -> `results/ticket_lifecycle_analysis.json`
- `python scripts/walk_forward_lookback_grid.py` -> `results/walk_forward_lookback_grid.json`

# Umsetzung

## Validation Summary

| Claim | Source | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|--------|----------|
| HYP_006 30.9% ROI | ticket_lifecycle_analysis.json | VERIFIED (with outlier warning) | 12 iterations, 1 HW outlier |
| Position-Rules delta_roi=0.0 | walk_forward_lookback_grid.json | VERIFIED | 35/35 comparisons |
| FDR 0/35 significant | walk_forward_lookback_grid.json | VERIFIED | BH correction alpha=0.1 |
