summary:
  - All 19 unit tests pass (test_stable_numbers.py) - 0.83s
  - Model Law A formula verified: stability = 1 - (std/mean), clamped [0,1]
  - Config uses physics.stability_threshold = 0.90 from default.yaml:30
  - CLI command `stable-numbers` with --window, --threshold, --all options
  - Import chain OK: kenobase.analysis -> stable_numbers (5 exports)
  - Syntax validation passes for all 3 modified files
  - Formula correctness verified with numeric test (0.974702 == expected)
  - StableNumberResult dataclass frozen with 7 fields

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-number
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): stability_score = 1 - (std/mean), is_stable = score >= 0.90
- Rule 4 (target metric): stability >= physics.stability_threshold (0.90)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_stable_numbers.py -v` -> 19 passed

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-number
- Semantics: stability_score = 1 - (std(rolling_freq) / mean(rolling_freq)), clamped to [0,1]
- Target metric: is_stable = stability_score >= physics.stability_threshold (0.90)

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_stable_numbers.py -v` -> 19 passed (0.83s)
- `python scripts/analyze.py stable-numbers --help` -> Shows all options
- `python -c "from kenobase.analysis import StableNumberResult, analyze_stable_numbers"` -> Import OK
