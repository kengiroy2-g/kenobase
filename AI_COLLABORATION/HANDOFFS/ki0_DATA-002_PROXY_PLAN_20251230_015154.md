status: APPROVED
task: DATA-002
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_DATA-002_ARCHITECT_20251230_014854.md"
summary:
  - Plan is mechanically complete with clear functions (normalize_number, denormalize_number, normalize_draw, normalize_numbers)
  - DrawResult model verified at data_loader.py:47-80 with game_type field
  - Game ranges verified at default.yaml:131-158 (KENO 1-70, EuroJackpot 1-50, Lotto 1-49)
  - Percentile-based normalization to [0.0, 1.0] is appropriate for cross-game comparison
  - INTEGRATION NOTE: cross_lottery_coupling.py uses KENO_MAX_NUMBER constant - future refactoring opportunity
  - Normalization is helper-only (pure transform), no state dependency
  - Plan addresses per-game granularity correctly (not global threshold)
  - Test strategy clear: pytest tests/unit/test_normalizer.py -v

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-game
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): numbers normalized to [0.0, 1.0]
- Rule 4 (target metric): cross-lottery correlation enablement
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_normalizer.py -v`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: per-game (KENO, Lotto, EuroJackpot)
- Semantics: (n - min) / (max - min)
- Target metric: cross-lottery correlation analysis

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_normalizer.py -v` -> Pass/Fail

# Proxy Review
