# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-game (KENO primary)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): spieleinsatz, jackpot, rolling_cv, state_label
- Rule 4 (target metric): bet-selection
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `pytest tests/unit/test_economic_state.py -v` -> 27 passed

## Repro Commands
- `pytest tests/unit/test_economic_state.py -v` -> 27 passed

## Verdict

**APPROVED** - Implementation correct. Minor finding: Config YAML section (lines 311-322) exists but is not parsed into `config.py`. This is acceptable for helper-only scope. Handoff created at:
