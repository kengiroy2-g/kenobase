summary:
  - Test file tests/unit/test_frozen_rules_invariant.py created with 6 comprehensive tests
  - All 6 tests pass (pytest 2.54s verified)
  - CrossGameRule dataclass confirmed frozen=True (line 33 in cross_game_rule_backtester.py)
  - Frozen-rules invariant properly validated through multiple angles
  - Test covers data leakage prevention (train dates <= train_end)
  - Test confirms backtest signature has no mining parameters
  - Test validates rule immutability via FrozenInstanceError
  - Implementation aligns with CLAUDE.md Section 3.0 Axiom-First approach

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): CrossGameRule frozen on Train, passed to backtest without re-mining
- Rule 4 (target metric): Out-of-Sample rule accuracy lift
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_frozen_rules_invariant.py -v` -> 6 passed VERIFIED

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global
- Semantics: Frozen rules pattern - rules mined on Train are immutable when applied to Test
- Target metric: Test validation (all 6 tests pass)

## Repro Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_frozen_rules_invariant.py -v` -> 6 passed in 2.54s VERIFIED

# Proxy Review (Implementation)

**APPROVED** - Implementation correctly validates the frozen-rules invariant.
