status: COMPLETE
task: INT-001
role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_FINAL
summary:
  - APPROVED: Pipeline Integration (INT-001) fully implemented and tested
  - VERIFIED: Physics Layer integrated in runner.py (lines 49-65 imports, 321-396 implementation)
  - VERIFIED: Model Law A (Stability) at line 342 via calculate_stability()
  - VERIFIED: Model Law B (Least-Action) in least_action.py via PipelineSelector
  - VERIFIED: Model Law C (Criticality) at line 361 via calculate_criticality_from_config()
  - VERIFIED: Avalanche Analysis at lines 368-385 with anti_avalanche_mode
  - VERIFIED: All 53 tests passed (15 runner + 25 least_action + 13 integration)
  - NO CODE CHANGES REQUIRED - Implementation was already complete

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): global (pipeline-level integration)
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): PipelineResult, PhysicsResult, SelectionResult dataclasses
- Rule 4 (target metric): integration correctness (all tests pass)
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_runner.py tests/unit/test_least_action.py tests/integration/test_pipeline_integration.py -v`

## Task Setup
- Granularity: global (full pipeline integration)
- Semantics: PipelineRunner orchestrates Frequency->Pattern->Physics->LeastAction flow
- Target metric: All tests pass, imports work, integration test successful

## Repro Commands
- `python -m py_compile kenobase/pipeline/runner.py` -> syntax OK
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_runner.py -v` -> 15 passed
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_least_action.py -v` -> 25 passed
- `python -m pytest tests/integration/test_pipeline_integration.py -v` -> 13 passed
