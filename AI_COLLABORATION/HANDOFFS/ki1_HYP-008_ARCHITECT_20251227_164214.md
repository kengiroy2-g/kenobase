## ARCHITECT Phase Complete

**Summary:**

The 111-Prinzip has been fully analyzed and documented:

1. **Definition:** A numerology-inspired filter method that accepts number combinations where:
   - Sum = 111 or multiples (222, 333...)
   - Sum divisible by factors 3, 11, 37, 111
   - Difference to 111 divisible by these factors
   - Also checks reversed/inverted numbers

2. **Code References:** Found 6 implementation files in `all_code/`:
   - `Iteration111.py` through `00_Iteration111_V5.py`
   - `Generator_plus_iterration_111.py`

3. **Scientific Assessment:** 
   - No scientific basis identified
   - Origin: Numerological speculation
   - Recommendation: Keep LOW priority, document as historical artifact

4. **Next Steps for EXECUTOR:**
   - Create `111_PRINZIP_DOKUMENTATION.md`
   - Update `HYPOTHESES_CATALOG.md` with findings
