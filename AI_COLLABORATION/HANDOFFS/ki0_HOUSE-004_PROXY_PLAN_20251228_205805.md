role: PROXY
phase: PROXY_PLAN
reviewed_handoff: "ki1_HOUSE-004_ARCHITECT_20251228_205505.md"
summary:
  - near_miss.py operates on GQ DataFrame with Keno-Typ segmentation (lines 100-148)
  - jackpot_correlation.py provides get_jackpot_dates() returning set[datetime] (lines 213-225)
  - GK1 data file confirmed at Keno_GPTs/10-9_KGDaten_gefiltert.csv (517 bytes)
  - Plan correctly proposes new module near_miss_jackpot.py combining both
  - No global thresholds issue - significance tests use standard p<0.05
  - Integration pattern follows existing HYP-015 analysis script pattern
  - Test file location tests/unit/test_near_miss_jackpot.py follows conventions
  - Script analyze_house004.py follows existing naming pattern (analyze_house002.py, analyze_house003.py exist)

# Rule Confirmation
- Rule 1 (SYSTEM_STATUS + ADR/Docs + git status): CONFIRMED
- Rule 2 (granularity stated): per-keno-type (2-10) segmented by jackpot/non-jackpot periods
- Rule 3 (semantics defined): near_miss_ratio = near_winners / max_winners per segment
- Rule 4 (target metric): Chi-square significance test (p < 0.05) comparing jackpot vs normal periods
- Rule 5 (helper-only boundaries): CONFIRMED
- Rule 6 (reproducibility): `python scripts/analyze_house004.py` -> `results/house004_near_miss_jackpot.json` (PLANNED)
